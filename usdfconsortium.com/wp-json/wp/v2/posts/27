The growth is just one step for the Consortium, which is giving banks and their customers a way to leverage the limitless potential of blockchain technology, including providing faster, less expensive digital transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe increase in membership is a testament to the Consortium\u2019s ability to provide in-depth guidance and connect banks with turn-key technology solutions as well as the transformative role that blockchain payment rails can play in financial services,\u201d said Ashley Harris, Chair of the USDF Consortium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amerant Bank, ConnectOne Bank, and Primis Bank have joined as the role of tokenized deposits as alternatives to stablecoin continues to gain traction with stakeholders. The USDF token is minted exclusively by U.S. banks and represents a deposit at a USDF Consortium bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are continuously looking to innovate to ensure that we can provide the best service to our clients in the most convenient and modern way,\u201d said Jerry Plush, Vice Chairman, President &amp; CEO of Amerant Bank. \u201cWe are pleased to be part of this consortium and to have a voice in the rapidly emerging world of blockchain and digital transactions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cConnectOne Bank\u2019s participation in the USDF Consortium supports our strategy of building leading commercial banking solutions supported by innovative technology,\u201d said ConnectOne Bank\u2019s Chairman &amp; CEO, Frank Sorrentino III. \u201cWe believe that employing blockchain within the regulatory perimeter, allows us to build effective and secure solutions for our clients that meet the demands of their changing businesses. We look forward to working alongside industry-leading banks in unlocking the opportunities that blockchain can provide.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe see the implementation, utilization, and commercialization of blockchain to be a key component in our future growth strategies. The USDF Consortium gives us the ability to provide our clients with a new, safe, and low-cost payment solution that goes above and beyond day-to-day deposit gathering and settlement,\u201d said Primis Bank Chief Financial Officer Matthew Switzer. \u201cPrimis is proud to be in partnership with the USDF Consortium and its members, and we look forward to the network\u2019s growth and the industry\u2019s further adoption of a bank-minted tokenized deposit.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeking to capitalize on its growth, the Consortium also announced today that it is making it easier for members to join by shifting to a tier-based participation model and eliminating the $1 billion minimum asset threshold. The group also retained leading financial services firm Piper Sandler to aid in its expected growth and help with its active pipeline of interested banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith the momentum that the Consortium has been experiencing and the meaningful interest we\u2019ve received, we felt the time was right to broaden access,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAs new members join, the network\u2019s value increases exponentially.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Piper Sandler will be able to offer guidance as the Consortium seeks to expand among the thousands of financial institutions in the U.S.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re extremely excited to help incumbent financial services providers drive growth and realize efficiencies through the adoption of blockchain technology,\u201d said Jonathan Doyle, Vice Chairman, Senior Managing Principal and Head of the Financial Services Group at Piper Sandler. \u201cWe see joining the USDF Consortium as an important first step for institutions looking to develop a broader blockchain strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>About USDF Consortium <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The USDF Consortium is a membership-based association of FDIC-insured banks.
