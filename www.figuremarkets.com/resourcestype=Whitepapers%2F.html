YLDS, a public security offered through Figure Markets&amp;rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary, Figure Certificate Company, is a fixed price, daily accrual public security native to the Provenance Blockchain. YLDS can be transferred peer-to-peer and is backed by the same securities that prime money market funds hold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;YLDS marks a transformative shift in financial applications built on public blockchain, offering holders the ability to earn interest, transfer securities peer-to-peer, and transact 24x7. YLDS utilizes Figure Markets&amp;rsquo;s self-custody wallets, giving users control of the tokens without relying on third parties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;We see tremendous applications for YLDS,&amp;rdquo; said Figure Markets CEO, Mike Cagney.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Exchange collateral, cross-border remittances, and payment rails are some of the immediate opportunities. But we see this as a catalyst to a much larger migration of TradFi to blockchain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Starting today, both individuals and institutions can purchase YLDS through Figure Markets (www.figuremarkets.com). Figure Markets &amp;ndash; working with its sister company &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figure.com/\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Figure Technology Solutions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;ndash; has been a leader in the real-world asset (RWA) space on blockchain, supporting over $41B in RWA transactions on the Provenance Blockchain, with over $13B in RWA total locked value on-chain. YLDS will add to that number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to support YLDS on Provenance Blockchain,&amp;rdquo; said June Ou, Interim Executive Director of the Provenance Blockchain Foundation. &amp;ldquo;We expect, and will support, significant third-party developer interest to use YLDS and its fiat rails in DeFi, payments, and other applications built on Provenance Blockchain. We will also be integral in wrapping YLDS for applications on other L1 blockchains.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;YLDS pays an interest rate of SOFR minus 0.50%. Interest is accrued daily and paid monthly in USD or YLDS.&amp;nbsp; Holders can buy/sell YLDS using USD and other stablecoins 24x7 on Figure Markets, and can off-ramp to fiat during US banking hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;###&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Figure Markets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Figure Markets is democratizing finance through blockchain.

Yet as the month progressed, BTC surged from around $93,000 to a record high above $105,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, following the inauguration of President Trump. Within three days, the new administration issued its &amp;ldquo;Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology&amp;rdquo; directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, forming the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The order established the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, tasked with crafting a federal crypto framework, assessing a national digital asset reserve, and halting federal CBDC work. While some industry participants wished for a fully formed reserve instead of a feasibility study, the move was widely welcomed as a step in the right direction, with clear objectives and timelines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Other regulatory developments throughout January continued to signal constructive progress. The SEC announced the formation of a dedicated Crypto Task Force to develop &amp;ldquo;comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;rdquo; and rescinded the unpopular SAB 121 accounting rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. Courts issued favorable rulings for industry participants as well: One found the SEC&amp;rsquo;s denial of Coinbase&amp;rsquo;s request for crypto rulemaking as &amp;ldquo;arbitrary and capricious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;and believes the SEC did not provide a sufficient reason for denying Coinbase&amp;rsquo;s request and another reversed sanctions on Tornado Cash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. Additionally, the number of states considering a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve is now up to 15, nearly doubling from early January&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. Meanwhile, several crypto-friendly officials assumed influential roles, just as prominent skeptics announced or confirmed departures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;However, the crypto market encountered a sharp downturn during the first weekend of February amid newly announced U.S. tariffs and growing trade-war fears. High leverage levels exacerbated the sell-off, leading to approximately $10bn in forced liquidations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;$Trump&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;On January 17th, during the inaugural Crypto Ball in Washington, DC, then-President-elect Donald Trump launched the Official Trump memecoin ($TRUMP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. The token peaked at $73.43 two days later, giving it a roughly $15bn market cap (and $73bn fully diluted)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. Melania Trump launched her own memecoin ($MELANIA) soon after, causing a strong pull back in $TRUMP and has mostly trended downward since.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The decision to launch $TRUMP on Solana has resulted in notable gains for the network. Over $43mm in on-chain fees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; were generated over the launch weekend (average $21mm/day vs. average $5mm/day this past month). Usually these meme tokens launch as MEME/SOL pairs but $TRUMP launched on DEX, Meteora, as a USDC pair. As a result of the demand, stablecoin supply on the Solana has nearly doubled in the past two weeks since launch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhibit 1: Total Solana Stablecoin Market Cap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1740067097-screenshot-2025-02-20-at-10-57-56-am.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;$TRUMP was polarizing to say the least. Critics called it a brazen attempt by Trump to enrich himself, noting that entities tied to him control 80% of the supply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. Others voiced concerns that it spotlights crypto&amp;rsquo;s speculative side, potentially alienating moderate policymakers who might otherwise support digital assets. Still, supporters welcomed Trump&amp;rsquo;s embrace of crypto, seeing the move as a likely sign of a more permissive U.S. regulatory environment. Despite the criticism, an estimated 400,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; new market entrants were onboarded through $TRUMP&amp;rsquo;s debut demonstrating the power of the crypto &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; and provided a glimpse of the potential wealth transfer across crypto rails for stocks, bonds, and payments once regulation clarity is established.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FTX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;On Feb 4th, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://x.com/FTX_Official/status/1886889964073373711\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;FTX_Official&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; announced that the FTX Recovery Trust anticipates commencement of distributions to creditors in the Plan&amp;rsquo;s convenience class (claims under $50,000) on February 18, 2025. These creditors are anticipated to receive roughly 119% of their claim value, reflecting a full 100% recovery of the petition-date value plus 9% interest accruing from November 11, 2022.&amp;nbsp; The two distribution service providers, BitGo and Kraken, are currently available for certain FTX creditors. Distributions will be made in US dollars, and each provider offers different withdrawal methods and fee structures (e.g., wire, ACH, stablecoins, digital assets).

Despite stock markets making all time highs, the Federal Reserve preemptively initiated a rate-cutting cycle reducing the federal funds rate by 100 basis&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;points over three cuts to 4.5%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. We are still scratching our heads as to what data the Fed was watching to prompt these cuts given the Goldman Sachs financial conditions index tracked lower throughout the year while stocks, and bitcoin, made new highs.&amp;nbsp; We will be closely watching the inflationary effects of these rate cuts coupled with the contemplated Trump tariffs, and expected expansionary fiscal policies. While the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) appears to have shifted its focus towards ending US inflation by cutting government overspending, this is no easy task. As a result, we believe the prediction of increased volatility is easier than the continued increase of risk assets broadly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;background-color: transparent; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; letter-spacing: 0px;\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;By far, the most impactful developments on the horizon are the potential regulatory changes under the new administration. With Trump taking office and SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepping down, a major U.S. crypto overhaul is expected. Meanwhile, the EU/s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, went into effect the end of December 2024, promulgating new rules, which aim to strengthen consumer protections and reduce fraud, among other things. Although this is a step in the right direction, we believe that MiCA may diminish the EU&#39;s attractiveness of the jurisdiction for crypto investors and innovators in the near term, especially as the pro-crypto Trump administration takes office. Notably, we believe the delisting of USDT, a critical source of liquidity for many DeFi applications, on EU-based exchanges will make it difficult for EU-based DeFi platforms to efficiently operate given the new barriers to access liquidity, potentially putting them at a disadvantage compared to their global counterparts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;AI Infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The rapid expansion of AI is driving significant demand for specialized data centers, which have become critical for handling massive computational workloads. Training advanced models requires clustering thousands of high-performance chips, fueling an arms race among tech giants to build and secure infrastructure that can accommodate these ever-growing needs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;This all costs money, fortunately, mega tech has plenty of it.&amp;nbsp; Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s plan to invest approximately $80bn to build out datacenters in 2025 exemplifies this shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. This trend is reinforced by Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s projections that their data center segment will generate over $100bn in sales in 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;As businesses intensify their reliance on AI across applications, from search engines to enterprise solutions, competition amongst the tech giants will also increase as the need for reliable AI infrastructure grows. We believe digital infrastructure will be the backbone of this progress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1737144806-screenshot-2025-01-17-at-3-12-33-pm.png\&quot; style=\&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;As discussed in our previous &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/bitcoin-ai-housing/\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, Bitcoin miners and AI data centers are increasingly converging around the same finite pool of resources. Following China&#39;s 2021 ban on bitcoin mining, the once China-dominated industry saw US miners rapidly expand, securing scalable and energy-efficient power infrastructure. These highly sought-after assets are now equally critical for specialized AI data centers. In fact, some miners diversifying their power portfolios to support AI data centers have significantly outperformed their peers - CORZ (+295%) and WULF (+244%) vs. CLSK (+33%) and RIOT (8%)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. As bitcoin miners allocate more of their capacity towards AI, we agree with a recent Bernstein report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; that their EV/MW may trade closer to traditional data center companies, which trade at a 90% premium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1737144927-screenshot-2025-01-17-at-3-13-41-pm.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;FTX Updates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The FTX Debtors Plan of Reorganization became effective on January 3, 2025. The first distributions will become available for convenience class claim holders within 60 days of the effective date. Convenience class holders should expect at least a 119% recovery on their claim&amp;rsquo;s petition date value. Separate record and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced. The two distribution service providers, BitGo and Kraken, are currently available for certain FTX creditors. Distributions will be made in US dollars, and each provider offers different withdrawal methods and fee structures (e.g., wire, ACH, stablecoins, digital assets).

November&amp;rsquo;s election and parallel rally have set the stage for what we believe is a transformative era for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. With an incoming administration signaling a favorable stance on crypto, the groundwork for widespread institutional adoption is taking shape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Momentum is evident in the numbers. In November, Bitcoin spot ETF inflows surged to $6.4bn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, surpassing the previous peak of $6bn in February. Despite the excitement, key positioning metrics remain measured marking the difference between a bull and an overheated market. The annualized basis for CME futures sits comfortably in the low-to-mid teens, a significant drop from the 35% levels seen in 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. Similarly, the average open interest-weighted funding rate for offshore perpetual futures is at 16% annualized &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, a far cry from the overheated peaks of over 100% &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;On-chain indicators, which have proven insightful in the past, suggest there is still room for further upside. The MVRV ratio currently stands at 2.7, well below the previous cycle peak of 4.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; and the market cap to thermocap ratio, which compares market value to the \&quot;book value\&quot; of coins, is at 28 or 44% off from the 50.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; peak of the last cycle. While the amplitude of each cycle has decreased over time, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin&#39;s $100,000 milestone shifted dramatically in November from &amp;ldquo;if,&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;when.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Strategic Reserve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Adding to Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s momentum, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis&amp;rsquo; BITCOIN Act of 2024, a bold proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve without increasing the national debt, among other things, has gained renewed interest following November&amp;rsquo;s election result. The plan involves acquiring 1mm Bitcoin or 5% &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; of the total supply for ~$100bn at today&amp;rsquo;s prices. The acquired Bitcoin would be held for a minimum term of 20 years, and can be used solely for the purpose of retiring&amp;nbsp; national debt during the holding period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The bill builds on Trump&amp;rsquo;s remarks in July at a Bitcoin conference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, where he pledged to establish a \&quot;national Bitcoin stockpile,\&quot; leveraging existing government-held Bitcoin assets, which are estimated at ~200,000 Bitcoin from asset seizures, yet it faces challenges. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/91175437/bitcoin-reserve-cynthia-lumis\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Skeptics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; argue the plan is risky due to Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s volatility. Prediction markets like Polymarket estimate just a 28%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; chance of the proposal becoming law. Proponents, however, believe this move could drive Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s value to $500,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, though concerns about destabilizing the gold market linger. Despite the criticism, Senator Lummis remains optimistic, buoyed by Trump&amp;rsquo;s endorsement and growing enthusiasm for crypto.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;FTX Updates&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;In other positive news, FTX released an updated timeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; for creditor and customer distributions with the first distributions expected in early 2025. Key milestones in the distribution process include the finalization of arrangements with distribution agents by early December. The Plan is anticipated to become effective in early January 2025, with the first distributions to holders of allowed claims in the Plan&#39;s Convenience Classes expected within 60 days thereafter. To be eligible for the Initial Distribution, customers must establish an approved account with a Distribution Agent, complete KYC verification, and submit required tax forms before the distribution record date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;FTX&amp;rsquo;s latest court filings reveal a cash position of approximately $12.2bn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. With around $974mm in crypto assets and $2bn in investments left to be monetized, the estate appears well-positioned to meet its stated recovery targets, particularly given the recent surge in crypto prices. As an added kicker, only ~25%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; of non-de minimis claim holders have completed KYC so far as of November 22nd. While users have until June 1st, 2025 to complete their KYC submissions, any value from claims with non-completed KYC reduces the total denominator, effectively increasing the recovery value per eligible claim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Ionic Updates&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Tony Vejseli, with the support of Figure Markets and GXD Labs, continues to stand firmly in support of Ionic Digital, Inc. stockholders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;In November, we issued a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/rebuttal-to-ionic-digital-faq/\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;comprehensive rebuttal to Ionic&amp;rsquo;s FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, reaffirming our commitment to improving transparency around the company&amp;rsquo;s financial and operational performance.

It enables users to earn APY on idle cash by placing it in a liquid, real-world asset-backed structure. This approach not only offers up to 8% APY on stablecoins but also allows eligible users to leverage their positions as collateral for trading on Figure Markets&amp;rsquo;s exchange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;For active traders, this collateral feature can support various strategies while allowing their stablecoins to generate returns.

This makes it an appealing choice for both seasoned crypto investors and those looking for a stable way to earn APY in a volatile market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Behind the scenes of Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault stands out by backing investments with real-world assets, specifically U.S. home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), to offer an opportunity to achieve steady growth on stablecoins. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it all works:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;1. HELOCs securing investment of stablecoins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault leverages a unique approach by backing investments with HELOCs. Think of a HELOC as a type of credit line that lets homeowners borrow against the equity they&amp;rsquo;ve built up in their homes. When homeowners borrow from this credit line, they pay interest on the amount borrowed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;2. How Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault delivers competitive returns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Forward Vault generates returns by using investor subscriptions to make collateralized loans to Figure Lending LLC, the number one non-bank HELOC lender in the U.S., secured by home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). In return, Figure Lending LLC pays Forward Vault interest at a rate of SOFR plus a margin of basis points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;SOFR is a benchmark index for determining rates at which banks would be willing to lend cash with the U.S. Treasuries as collateral in the overnight repo market. Forward Vault automatically passes the interest accruals to investors, minus fees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;3. Efficiency through blockchain technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The use of blockchain technology allows Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault to accrue daily returns, a feature not easily achieved through traditional financial systems. Users can request a withdrawal at any moment, allowing them to access their invested cash seamlessly. Additionally, earnings remain intact, with no loss of what has already been gained upon withdrawal. By streamlining fund access and enhancing security, blockchain adds significant appeal to the product for investors seeking both flexibility and transparency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;4. Anchoring returns to RWA&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;By anchoring investments with assets like home equity lines of credit, Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault offers a reliable way to gain APY on stablecoins with moderate risk. These types of assets have a long-standing role in traditional finance, and may provide a degree of stability in an unpredictable market.

These can include a lack of transparency in how funds are managed, the possibility of mismanagement or fraud, and the risk of the platform failing. Many traders remain unaware of these vulnerabilities, assuming their assets are safe, only to find them at risk when the platform suddenly collapses and they lose their funds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;This situation has led to a growing demand for secure and reliable solutions. Traders and investors are now seeking platforms that offer greater control, transparency, and trust. Figure Markets addresses these vulnerabilities by offering a decentralized custody model powered by Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology and self-custody wallets. By combining this approach with other features like crypto-backed loans and daily-yield opportunities, Figure Markets delivers the best of TradFi and DeFi, all in one platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;In this article we will explore:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Decentralized custody model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Daily-yield opportunities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Crypto-backed loans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Future expansion into traditional investment assets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Decentralized custody and asset control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Traditional centralized exchanges come with significant risks. In those systems, users must entrust their assets to a central custodian, exposing them to potential mismanagement and platform failure. The downfall of platforms like FTX highlights the risks inherent in centralized custody, where users have limited control over their assets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Figure Markets tackles these risks by offering a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/whitepaper/delivering-on-the-potential-of-multi-party-computation-technology/\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;self-custody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt; approach. This model allows users to hold a 1:1 representation of their assets in their own wallets, with no central party controlling access or transactions. Control and security is augmented with the use of MPC technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;What is MPC technology and how it enables decentralized custody&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology emerged in the early 1980&amp;rsquo;s as a method to enable multiple participants to compute a result without exposing their private data. In the context of digital assets, MPC has become a foundational technology for decentralized wallets and custodians to secure crypto assets. But how exactly does it work, and why is it crucial for investors who value asset security?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;In technical terms, MPC technology is a cryptographic protocol that splits a private key into several fragments and distributes these key shares among MPC hosts. An MPC host can be understood as a secure and independent participant in the network that holds a portion of the key. For a transaction to be validated, these hosts must collaborate to combine their key shares, enabling the transaction without any one host ever having the full key.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;To simplify, think of MPC technology as a form of team collaboration with a shared responsibility. Imagine a valuable asset locked behind a vault with multiple locks, each held by different trusted individuals called MPC hosts. Each host holds a part of the key, and no single host can open the vault alone. They must work together, each contributing their key part, to unlock the vault and access the asset inside. This collaborative effort means that no single individual has full control, which mitigates the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1731360026-screenshot-2024-11-11-at-4-19-10-pm.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;By implementing this system, Figure Markets enhances security, transparency, and trust; mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and limiting the vulnerabilities that are inherent in centralized control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault - Earn up to 8% on your stablecoins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Figure Markets stands out as a great alternative to traditional centralized exchanges, by offering not just decentralized custody but also daily-yield opportunities. Through the Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault, eligible users can earn up to 8% APY* on their cash and stablecoins. This approach allows users to grow their crypto holdings in a smart, innovative, and liquid way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Compared to traditional centralized exchanges, this model provides several key advantages:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Figure Markets offers eligible users up to 8% APY on stablecoins, while major exchanges like Coinbase only provide around 4-6%** APY on stablecoins.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backed by Real-World Assets (RWA):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Your interest in the Fo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;rwa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;rd Vault is backed by RWAs, providing a stable and reliable source of returns.

The most obvious being the election, now less than a few days away. Markets appear to be pricing in a potential Trump victory, as his lead on some prediction markets has widened to nearly 30%&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. Trump has offered to provide the industry its collective wishlist if elected&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. As such, we do not believe any further crypto policy announcements from Trump would have a material impact on crypto markets, unless he flips his position, which we believe is unlikely. Harris, on the other hand, has yet to provide further details on her crypto policy outside of giving vague promises on protecting innovation and protecting investors. Whether or not either candidate acts on their promises is yet to be seen, but Trump is generally viewed as a more crypto-friendly candidate. Either way, this election cycle has proved that crypto is too big of an issue to ignore - 44% of all corporate money contributed during this year&amp;rsquo;s election came from crypto backers&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. We believe a Trump or Kamala victory would be positive for crypto. Elections have historically dragged markets, given the uncertainty, and either administration would be an improvement from the status quo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Looking beyond the elections, the Fed&#39;s recent pivot towards lower front end rates in conjunction with the markets becoming more concerned around fiscal discipline, will likely continue to benefit crypto markets. Increased global liquidity has been historically positive for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. November 7th will be a key date to watch as recent positive economic data suggests that the Fed is likely to opt for a lower 25 bps cut in November, if they cut at all. This could positively impact prices in conjunction with a new President-elect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stripe Announced Acquisition of Bridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;On October 21st, Stripe announced its acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1bn&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;, setting a record as the largest crypto acquisition to date. Major payment processors like Visa and SWIFT have already taken steps to natively support stablecoins, as detailed in our previous &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/navigating-volatility-stablecoin-adoption-solana-rise/\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This acquisition further highlights the growing importance of integrating stablecoins into conventional payment networks. We believe stablecoin adoption represents a meaningful improvement over current payment infrastructure, offering advantages like near-instant settlement, lower costs, and reduced counterparty risks thanks to blockchain technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FTX Plan Confirmed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved the FTX wind-down plan on October 7th, 2024.&amp;nbsp; Crypto markets have rebounded nearly 3x since then. The Estate is estimated to have recouped between $14.7bn and $16.5bn following a series of settlements with customers and creditors, government agencies, as well as liquidation of various assets on its balance, according to court filings&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;. This amount is enough for certain customers to recover at least 118% of the value in their accounts as of November 2022. We expect Class 7 claims (&amp;lt;$50,000) to begin receiving their distributions as soon as December and January. While Class 5 claimholders are expected to start receiving distributions in February. We will continue to keep our readers informed on the latest FTX developments. We are hopeful that the first distribution to Class 5 claims holders will be 100% of their claim value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ionic Digital Special Meeting Request&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;On October 16th, Figure Markets sent a form to the disaffected shareholders of Ionic requesting additional disclosures required to call a Special Meeting.

This request seeks information to investigate potential misconduct by the Board of Directors and assess their performance of fiduciary duties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Figure Markets and Mr. Vejseli believe access to these records (the &amp;ldquo;Books and Records&amp;rdquo;) is crucial for protecting shareholder interests. This request arises from concerns about potential self-dealing behavior by board members and actions that may have disadvantaged shareholders. Specific areas of investigation include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agreements with Hut 8 Corp: &lt;/b&gt;The approval of and entry into certain agreements, including a Management Services Agreement, with Hut 8 Corp., an owner of bitcoin mining operations that operates as a direct competitor to the Company and whose CEO Asher Genoot, despite this conflict, also serves on the Company&amp;rsquo;s board of directors (the &amp;ldquo;Board&amp;rdquo;);&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;High Board compensation packages: &lt;/b&gt;The determination of Board compensation, pursuant to which, based on Ionic&amp;rsquo;s public filings, members of Ionic&amp;rsquo;s Board will receive annual compensation of $240,000, $75,000 of which will be paid in cash and $165,000 of which will be paid in Company equity incentives, with additional compensation of up to $180,000 (in cash or equity, at the election of the Board member) for membership on committees of the Board, with the result that a director could therefore receive total annual compensation from the Company of as much as &lt;i&gt;$420,000 per year&lt;/i&gt;, of which as much as $255,000 could be paid out in cash;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restrictions on trading Ionic stock:&lt;/b&gt; The decision to direct the Company&amp;rsquo;s transfer agent to refuse to process any trades of the Company&amp;rsquo;s Class A Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the &amp;ldquo;Class A Common Stock&amp;rdquo;), which appears to have been undertaken with the intent and effect of preventing any shareholder of the Company from accumulating a large position in the Class A Common Stock that could allow it to challenge the Board and hold directors accountable for the Company&amp;rsquo;s performance, and which has also cut off any available liquidity to the Company&amp;rsquo;s shareholders; and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Delays in registering the company&amp;rsquo;s Class A Common Stock: &lt;/b&gt;The filing and amendment of the Company&amp;rsquo;s registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was first filed over eight months ago, despite which the Class A Common Stock remains unregistered and unlisted, leaving shareholders with no liquidity and no path to unlocking any of the Company&amp;rsquo;s value.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on interactions with the Board, information included in the Company&amp;rsquo;s public filings, and other publicly available information, Figure Markets and Mr. Vejseli believe this Books and Records request is critical to protect shareholders&amp;rsquo; best interests. We are concerned that the Board may be acting to entrench itself to the detriment of the Company&amp;rsquo;s shareholders and believe the Books and Records request will help us to investigate potential fiduciary wrongdoing and evaluate potential corrective measures and appropriate actions in the event certain directors or others did not properly discharge their fiduciary duties, which may include but are not limited to removal of directors for cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To date, we have witnessed a pattern of apparently self-dealing behavior by current members of the Board during their service on the Committee, described in detail in the Books and Records demand and evidenced by:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;rejection of the multiple proposals from Figure Market during the Chapter 11 process pursuant to which the Company acquired its bitcoin mining assets, which proposals offered a solution to the management of the Company&amp;rsquo;s assets and a path to liquidity for shareholders;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the approval of the transactions with Hut 8, which appear to have been structured to circumvent the SEC&amp;rsquo;s rejection of a prior proposal with an affiliate of Hut 8 and to avoid a shareholder vote on the merits of the deal with Hut 8;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the self-appointment of many decision-makers in the Chapter 11 process, including co-chairs of the Unsecured Creditors&amp;rsquo; Committee (the &amp;ldquo;Committee&amp;rdquo;) Thomas DiFiore and Scott Duffy and lead advisor to the Committee Emmanuel Aidoo;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;self-dealing by board members of substantial cash and stock compensation packages; and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;serious and unreasonable delay in the consummation of the listing and registration of the Class A Common Stock.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having been involved in the Celsius bankruptcy from the beginning, it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate how creditors have been treated,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Cagney, CEO of Figure Markets. &amp;ldquo;We hope by forcing a special shareholder meeting to improve the management, governance and strategy of Ionic, we can salvage value for shareholders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are concerned that the recent actions taken by the Board may have been undertaken with interests other than those of the Company&amp;rsquo;s shareholders in mind, and we believe that the actions of members of the Board may constitute gross negligence and provide cause for removal. Even more, we are concerned that members of the Board acted, during and after the Chapter 11 proceedings, to deprive the shareholders of the Company of a say in the Company&amp;rsquo;s governance, and we believe that this Books and Records request is an important first step towards a restoration of shareholder democracy at Ionic, where investors can speak directly to the Board without intermediation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the Books and Records request will allow Figure Markets and Mr. Vejseli to investigate potential misconduct and assess individual directors&amp;rsquo; independence, performance of the Board and/or management&amp;rsquo;s fiduciary duties, and the potential for conduct rising to the level of gross negligence and constituting cause for removal of directors. We urge them to act with urgency and finally work with us in good faith to address shareholders&amp;rsquo; concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The full text of the Books and Records demand can be found &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/Ionic_Digital_220_Demand_(12618606.1).pdf\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,null],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-09-06T02:22:28+01:00&quot;]}],&quot;relatedResources&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-10-31T07:00:00+00:00&quot;],&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;shareholder-led-group-sets-record-straight-on-its-meeting-with-ionic-digital&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1711563133-image-1.png&quot;]}],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Shareholder-Led Group Sets the Record Straight on Its Meeting with Ionic Digital&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets | Ionic Meeting Press Release&quot;]}],&quot;multipleBlockContent&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;disclaimerGroup&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Default Long&quot;],&quot;disclaimerType&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks.

(&amp;ldquo;Ionic&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Company&amp;rdquo;), together with Figure Markets Holdings Inc. and GXD Labs, LLC (collectively, &amp;ldquo;the Group&amp;rdquo;) announced today their intention to set the record straight on the events of their meeting with the board of directors (the &amp;ldquo;Board&amp;rdquo;), management and counsel of Ionic on the afternoon of October 28th at the offices of White &amp;amp; Case, LLP in midtown Manhattan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The Group would like to thank White &amp;amp; Case for hosting and the members of the Board and management team for attending.&amp;nbsp; However, in the Group&amp;rsquo;s view Ionic&amp;rsquo;s subsequent press release was littered with inaccuracies and blatant falsehoods regarding the meeting, which the Group believes require prompt clarification.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;It was quite clear to the Group that Ionic did not &amp;ldquo;reaffirm&amp;rdquo; its strong momentum in the meeting.&amp;nbsp; Instead, the Group came away with the impression that the Board demonstrated minimal command of the fundamental operating metrics which any qualified director should have at their fingertips, and which knowledge would certainly be expected of a Board paying itself approximately $450,000 per director per year of shareholder money.&amp;nbsp; The conversation was far from confidence inspiring and left the Group more concerned about Ionic&amp;rsquo;s current competitive position and valuation than when they started the meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Mr. Vejseli asked a series of basic questions regarding the Company&amp;rsquo;s operations and performance, recapped in his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://x.com/elveton101/status/1851434124617400724\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;post &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;on X, to which any shareholder of any corporation would reasonably expect to receive answers, but which were instead met with zero substantive engagement from anyone at the Company.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, despite Ionic&amp;rsquo;s claim to &amp;ldquo;laser-focus&amp;rdquo; on implementing its &amp;ldquo;plan&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;It was apparent that the Board had not considered the possibility of other liquidity options for shareholders and had no explanation for the Board-imposed trading restrictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The Group presented several options that seek to ensure listing and liquidity in a regulatorily-compliant marketplace; however, it was clear none of these options had been researched or given adequate consideration by the Board.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Neither the Board nor management could articulate a path forward with respect to its contract with its apparent competitor Hut 8, in which the Company is stuck and neither the Board nor management seemed able to comprehend the Group&amp;rsquo;s proposed solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Despite repeated requests, the Company could not produce a single number with respect to its operating performance, making the Group skeptical of the ability of the Company and its new auditor to complete a proper audit by the end of Q1 2025.&amp;nbsp; The Board&amp;rsquo;s celebration of hiring this new auditor after six months, with the completion of the audit subject to further delay, is in the Group&amp;rsquo;s eyes yet another example of the directors&amp;rsquo; failure to understand the reality and gravity of the Company&amp;rsquo;s situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;No one from Ionic was able to disclose a single expense number during the meeting, as they have been unable to do for the last nine months, nor could they even provide a figure for the Company&amp;rsquo;s EBITDA. The Group is extremely skeptical of Ionic&amp;rsquo;s promise to communicate often, transparently and informatively in light of the absolute lack of transparency displayed to date and its ongoing failure to provide basic information let alone critical information relating to expenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The Group presented a proposal for much-needed Board refreshment at the Company, which it believes can help restore shareholders faith in the Company and its management and put the Company on the path to profitability and liquidity.. The Group proposed that Tom DiFiore, Scott Duffy and Emmanuel Aidoo step down the Board, to be replaced by three new, independent directors with the requisite experience and skill sets absent from the current Board.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The Group also suggested pathways to provide liquidity for shareholders and set the Company on a road to sustainability that the current Board seems to have ignored to date. Contrary to the Company&amp;rsquo;s assertion that critical details were absent from the Group&amp;rsquo;s proposals, the Group notes that all key components of its plan were included in the presentation provided to the entire Board and Ionic management. However, it is clear to the Group that the Board as currently constituted may be incapable of properly considering or implementing these proposals at all. The Group believes the current members of the Board are unqualified to act as fiduciaries and unable to execute on its ideas given their long-term track record of inexperience and value destruction, but a reconstituted Board acting in the best interests of shareholders could properly consider and evaluate all viable options for the Company&amp;rsquo;s future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The Group reiterates its certainty that Ionic is not a &amp;ldquo;best in class&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;leader&amp;rdquo; nor &amp;ldquo;emerging innovator&amp;rdquo; in the bitcoin mining industry and that it is time for change at the board level.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The Group urges shareholders to show their support for a special meeting to vote to remove Scott Duffy, Tom DiFore and Emmanuel Aidoo from the Board for cause by filling out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://figuremarkets.jotform.com/form/242827444894065\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;this form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,null],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-10-30T22:45:05+00:00&quot;]}],&quot;relatedResources&quot;:[1,[]]}],[0,{&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-09-30T22:17:48+01:00&quot;],&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;bitcoins-bullish-future&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;The latest edition of Markets on Markets explores how recent regulatory developments, the convergence of Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, and activist investing are shaping Bitcoin&#39;s trajectory toward new all-time highs.&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin&#39;s Bullish Future: Regulatory Clarity, Technological Convergence, and Activist Investing&quot;]}],&quot;multipleBlockContent&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;disclaimerGroup&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets on Markets Vol6&quot;],&quot;disclaimerType&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets on Markets v6 sources&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;1.&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/federal-debt-deficit-trump-harris-5a0d30d2\&quot;&gt;https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/federal-debt-deficit-trump-harris-5a0d30d2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.coinglass.com/today\&quot;&gt;https://www.coinglass.com/today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.theblock.co/post/311784/bernstein-notes-growing-investor-interest-in-bitcoin-miners-pivoting-to-ai\&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;https://www.theblock.co/post/311784/bernstein-notes-growing-investor-interest-in-bitcoin-miners-pivoting-to-ai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Yahoo Finance, as of 9/30/24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;The views and opinions expressed in these materials are&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;The views and opinions expressed in these materials are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or positions of any entities they represent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;This document is a general communication being provided for informational purposes only&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;This document is a general communication being provided for informational purposes only.

Post September 18ths aggressive 50s bps cut, the backdrop is now set for higher BTC prices&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regulatory developments give some insight into what the &amp;ldquo;next wave&amp;rdquo; of decentralization will look like&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin mining and AI data centers continue to converge. It&#39;s all about energy infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Figure Markets continues to fight for Ionic shareholders&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Fed&#39;s pivot and Bitcoin&#39;s rally&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the NASDAQ being only 5.5% off its all time high, the Fed implemented an aggressive 50 bps cut in its most recent meeting.&amp;nbsp; This seemingly &amp;ldquo;preemptive&amp;rdquo; cut despite the strong economy will prove to be the harbinger of yet another, or should we say continued, bull run in BTC.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;I do not think that anyone should look at this and say, &amp;lsquo;Oh this is the new pace&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Powell was quoted, however but as we have written in the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/bitcoin-ai-housing/\&quot;&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;, the Fed does not have a strong history of keeping to its word.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe the Fed is looking at the Presidential candidates and their spending plans and thinking about lower rates to finance the impending ballooning deficits. Trump plans on adding over $2.5tn to the annual deficit&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. While Kamala is only slight better by adding a mere $1.5tn / year on top of current $1.9trn current run rate&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if the rate environment / budget deficit alone was not enough to feel bullish, the historical seasonality&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also playing to BTC&#39;s favor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory landscape updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Figure Markets Insights would not be complete without a regulatory update and there are two developments worth highlighting.&amp;nbsp; First is the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-111?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--oPfdbsIh5JAGqckFQxsKnvdrP1WxaLgvo4W_geghq4p8qHVNGfTUDffN00qsJpVtqVQZ3tQD_iDAOJEyOp0HOKWtRBQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=323421410&amp;amp;utm_content=323421410&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email\&quot;&gt;SEC&amp;rsquo;s enforcement actions&lt;/a&gt; against Galios&amp;nbsp; which solidifies the stance that many tokens are in fact equity securities and as a result, Registered Investment Advisors need to hold those securities with a Qualified Custodian.&amp;nbsp; We at Figure Markets have an ideological position with this rule, given our belief in true decentralization.&amp;nbsp; We do not have an issue with a regulated entity needing to hold assets with another regulated entity,&amp;nbsp; Where we pause is a regulated entity holding its assets with a SINGLE other regulated entity.&amp;nbsp; With Figure Markets&amp;rsquo; MPC technology, the MPC shards are held by 3-4 distinct entities. Thus giving the investor the comfort of a legal framework for protection but not having to take the risks associated with a single, levered counterparty.&amp;nbsp; Getting the regulators to adopt this technology will be no easy task, however we at Figure Markets have never shied away from challenges and will work to make this concept a reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second is the &lt;a href=\&quot;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.273.2.pdf\&quot;&gt;amended complaint &lt;/a&gt;against Binance US.&amp;nbsp; Here the SEC has dug its heels on the fact that the 10 most active coins on the Binance exchange are in fact securities; but more importantly, the layer 2 ERC token BNB was issued and marketed as being tied to the financial performance of the Binance exchange itself is also a security.&amp;nbsp; We agree.&amp;nbsp; If it looks like a duck, it quacks like a duck, it&#39;s a duck and should be regulated as such.&amp;nbsp; However, let&#39;s not lose sight of the inherent value creation in a community that shares in the profits of the products in which it consumes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The convergence of Bitcoin mining and AI data centers&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The convergence of bitcoin mining and AI datacenters continues and our long held thesis that it is really all about energy infrastructure continues to play out.&amp;nbsp; Some notable transactions in the space include &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-blackrock-plan-30-bln-fund-invest-ai-infrastructure-ft-reports-2024-09-17/\&quot;&gt;Microsoft and Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; announcing that they are launching a $30bn fund to invest in datacenter infrastructure.&amp;nbsp; Open AI is raising money at a &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openais-stunning-150-billion-valuation-hinges-upending-corporate-structure-2024-09-14/\&quot;&gt;$150bn valuation&lt;/a&gt;, CoreWeave Said In Talks for Share Sale at &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-talks-share-sale-23-bln-valuation-bloomberg-news-reports-2024-09-13/\&quot;&gt;$23 Billion Valuation&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Bernstein dubbed this strategy as the &amp;ldquo;datacenter mullet, AI In the front, bitcoin in the back&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.\&quot; Talen, the power producer which was early to recognize the trend of this convergence with the trifecta of power generation, a behind the meter cloud computing data center and a bitcoin mine, has been rewarded by the market.&amp;nbsp; Talen&amp;rsquo;s share price has nearly quadrupled from its post bankruptcy trading price to $179&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We firmly believe that the AI datacenter model has much to learn from the bitcoin industry, most notably the demand response features inherent in bitcoin mining, i.e. when energy prices spike, bitcoin miners simply stop mining. This &amp;ldquo;service&amp;rdquo; to the grid has long been a source of income for energy focused mining / infrastructure players. In August of 2023, Riot made 3x more money selling power to the grid and &lt;a href=\&quot;https://news.bitcoin.com/riot-showcases-demand-response-strategy-bitcoin-minings-role-in-strengthening-texas-energy-grid/\&quot;&gt;earning demand response fees&lt;/a&gt; than they did mining bitcoin. Unfortunately we cannot build power plants as quickly as we can build data centers and as a result the market will likely force these data centers to become more efficient. The &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; of AI data centers most certainly will become intermittent as AI learns a thing or two from bitcoin mining.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Figure Markets&#39; Fight for Ionic Shareholders&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On September 4th Figure Markets, on the behalf of shareholder Venton Vejseli, sent a letter to Ionic Digital exercising shareholders&amp;rsquo; rights by demanding a shareholder contact list and Board correspondence.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of these requests is to demonstrate the ineffectiveness and incompetence of the Board of Directors and to lead the shareholders to a call to action for a leadership change.&amp;nbsp; The company responded on September 11th indicating that they understood their legal obligation to provide such information and Figure Markets is currently working with the company to obtain the desired information.&amp;nbsp; We currently have over 30% of the shareholder base in support of the initiative. We remain committed to getting Ionic shareholders their money back via bitcoin distributions and potential liquidity via trading the stock on an ATS operated by FINRA Member and Figure Markets subsidiary, Figure Securities.&amp;nbsp;

Our Co-Founder and CEO, Mike Cagney, sent a &lt;a href=\&quot;http://www.figuremarkets.com/Figure-Markets-Ionic-Letter.pdf\&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the two UCC members on Ionic&amp;rsquo;s board requesting a special meeting to discuss strategic paths forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Macro Tailwinds&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On August 23rd, Jerome Powell declared that &amp;ldquo;the time for policy adjustment has arrived&amp;rdquo; at the central bank&amp;rsquo;s annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, signaling the conclusion of the Fed&amp;rsquo;s historic inflation-fighting campaign. The Fed&amp;rsquo;s pivot comes as labor market data cools, with July&amp;rsquo;s unemployment hitting a three-year high of 4.3%&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and revised payroll figures showing 818,000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; fewer jobs added in the last 12 months through March. Investors were already expecting a rate cut by September given the drag current rates have had on economic activity, but markets still reacted positively. Following Powell&amp;rsquo;s remarks, crypto markets surged nearly 7%, with Bitcoin reaching $64,300&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, as investors saw this as a signal to embrace risk-on assets. We believe the macro set up is becoming increasingly favorable for crypto, driven by anticipated rate cuts and an election year in which both presidential candidates, to varying degrees, have expressed interest in establishing clearer regulations for the crypto industry &amp;mdash; a move that the US urgently needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking it a step further, Trump recently announced he wants Bitcoin to be &amp;ldquo;mined, minted, and made&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; in the US. Currently, US miners produce nearly 25%&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; of Bitcoin, a figure we expect will rise as new facilities come online in the US. With 90%&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; of Bitcoin mining machines made by China&#39;s Bitmain, we expect a Trump administration would likely impose tariffs on these machines. Some US miners have begun to hedge against geopolitical risk by sourcing ASICs domestically, as seen in the recent Core Scientific and Block &lt;a href=\&quot;https://investors.block.xyz/investor-news/news-details/2024/Blocks-New-Bitcoin-Mining-Chip-to-Be-Part-of-an-Ongoing-Project-With-Core-Scientific-to-Decentralize-Mining-Hardware/default.aspx\&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt;. We discuss the implications at length in an earlier &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/political-shifts-ftx-cftc-settlement-and-blocks-asic-breakthrough/\&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt;. In summary, the Bitcoin Network needs greater diversification in how it is secured to achieve true decentralization. We believe this is the step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin Transaction Fees&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Bitcoin has seen a significant increase in transaction fees, which we believe is driven by growing demand for block space due to new and emerging use cases. In the 12 months through July 2024, users have paid approximately $1.3bn in transaction fees, compared to the $296mm in the year prior&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Adjusting for average BTC prices between the two periods, this equates to approximately a 115% increase in transaction fees&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. Key protocol upgrades like the 2017 Segregated Witness (SegWit) and the 2021 Taproot update, have expanded Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s capacity to handle more complex transactions. These updates have paved the way for new applications like Ordinals and Inscriptions, enabling users the ability to create NFTs by embedding data to specific satoshis&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;ldquo;sats&amp;rdquo;) on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals create the \&quot;non-fungible\&quot; property for NFTs by utilizing a numbering system to order sats, while Inscriptions are the actual contents of the NFT, such as images, text, or other data. Since launching at the beginning of 2023, Inscription-related transactions have comprised of over 25% share of all BTC fees&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; on certain days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: BTC Fees vs. Inscription Fee Share&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1725663095-figure-markets-btc-fees-vs-inscription-fee-share.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As developers keep pushing the boundaries of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s capabilities, we expect transaction activity and, ultimately, fees to continue rising. While there has been debate on the usefulness of Ordinals and Inscriptions, given the risk of \&quot;blockchain bloat,\&quot; we believe it is important to recognize that these innovations could lead to use cases that drive broader adoption and utility for Bitcoin. We believe that the development of use cases beyond just a store of value is essential for Bitcoin&#39;s long-term security, particularly as block rewards, the primary incentive for miners, continue to halve every four years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 8/21/2024, FTX &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-announces-overwhelming-support-from-creditors-for-plan-of-reorganization-302227961.html\&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the amended Plan of Reorganization has received overwhelming preliminary support from over 95% of creditors who voted, reportedly representing 99% of eligible claims by value. The Plan is expected to exceed the required acceptance thresholds. Under the Plan, the estate estimates $11.2bn of allowable claims with estimated customer recoveries ranging from 119% to 143% of their Petition Date claim values, following the resolution of some of the largest governmental claims, as detailed in our earlier &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/political-shifts-ftx-cftc-settlement-and-blocks-asic-breakthrough/\&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt;. FTX will submit the final voting results to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware before the Confirmation Hearing, scheduled to begin on 10/7/2024. We will keep our readers informed on any other relevant updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Ionic Digital&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ionic Digital is a Bitcoin mining company that was formed earlier this year to help generate additional recoveries for Celsius Network creditors through shares in a public Bitcoin mining company. $740mm&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; of Celsius&amp;rsquo;s assets were transferred to Ionic to help jump start its operations, representing approximately 15% of creditors&amp;rsquo; total recovery&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the company is currently facing several challenges&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;, including their CEO stepping down, their auditor resigning, and a poorly structured management agreement with a competitor, Hut 8, that is costing the company ~$15mm&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; per year. Most concerning, however, is the Board&amp;rsquo;s recent decision to waive the Liquidity Deadline provision&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; in the Hut 8 Management Services Agreement - a move we believe disadvantages shareholders by leaving them without a clear path to a listing on a National Securities Exchange (NSE) or Alternative Trading System (ATS).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite recent efforts, communication from Ionic to its creditor-turned-shareholders has been abysmal, raising accountability issues concerning the current leadership and board. In response, on August 13th, Figure Markets&amp;rsquo;s Co-Founder and CEO, Mike Cagney, sent a &lt;a href=\&quot;http://www.figuremarkets.com/Figure-Markets-Ionic-Letter.pdf\&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the two UCC members on Ionic&amp;rsquo;s Board requesting a special meeting to discuss strategic paths forward. Unfortunately, the Board has been unresponsive and thus we are seeking to rally support from Ionic shareholders to force a special shareholder meeting to effectuate change for the benefit of shareholders. We believe that with adequate management and proper governance, there is a viable path to value creation for Ionic shareholders.

Despite this, the fundamentals and adoption of crypto remain strong. Typically during periods of heightened economic uncertainty, the Federal Reserve will attempt to stabilize the economy by easing monetary policy, which tends to lead to an increase in crypto prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Growing Stablecoin Adoption\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Stablecoin transaction volumes in Q2 2024 was at $6.5T, up over 200% from Q2 2023&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The slowing economy has prompted the Fed to ease, flipping its stance from fighting inflation to protecting growth and preventing a recession. The Fed Fund futures markets are already pricing in an aggressive response, with the implied probability of a 50 bps cut by the Fed&amp;rsquo;s September meeting now at 68%, a significant increase from just 12% the previous week&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Futures markets have now priced in an additional two rate cuts, bringing the total to five by January of next year&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. As US rates declined, the rapid unwinding of the Yen carry trade led to a ~25% drop in Japanese markets on 8/5/24 from the Nikkei&amp;rsquo;s all-time high just 15 trading days earlier&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Heightened concerns over geopolitical risks in the Middle East exacerbated this situation. The VIX surged above 60 on 8/5/24, its highest level since March 2020 when it peaked at 85.47 during the Covid-19 pandemic&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. As crowded trades began to unwind, the crypto market was not spared due to the negative convexity from exchange leverage. Crypto exchange position liquidations reached levels not seen since April of this year&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: BTC Exchange Liquidations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1723762965-figure-markets-btc-exchange-liquidations.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as we have noted before, the fundamentals and adoption trends in crypto remain strong. When states began implementing shutdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, BTC fell from ~$8,000 to $4,900&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, wiping out roughly a year&amp;rsquo;s worth of gains in 24 hours. As global leaders stepped in to stabilize the economy - cutting interest rates and printing money - crypto markets began to rise. A year later, BTC was trading at $57,000, up more than 1,000%. Whenever the Fed goes into easing and money printing mode, we think it makes sense to buy the (Fed) Flip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further strengthening our long-term view on crypto markets is the continued demand of crypto ETFs. Spot BTC ETFs continue to shatter their daily net inflow records, totaling $17bn of net flows since launching in January&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, nine spot ETH ETFs officially began trading on 7/24/24. These ETFs experienced relatively weaker demand relative to the spot Bitcoin ETFs (~23%&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; of volume) on its debut day. This is unsurprising given the lack of a staking element as discussed in previous commentary. That said, the nine spot ETH ETFs still traded over $1bn in volume&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, some of which finished the day among the top 50 highest-trade U.S. ETF debuts of all time&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: Spot ETH ETF Flows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Ticker / Issuer&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Total Flows Estimate ($mms)&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETHA / Blackrock&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$760.6&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;FETH / Fidelity&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$312.9&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETHW / Bitwise&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$294.4&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;CETH / 21Shares&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$10.7&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;QETH / Invesco and Galaxy&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$14.3&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;EZET / Franklin Resources&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$31.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETHV / VanEck&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$67.7&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETHE / Grayscale&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;-$2,161.6&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETH / Grayscale (Mini)&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$208.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total Gross (Ex. ETHE)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$1,700.7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Growing Stablecoin Adoption&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The global payments infrastructure is still dominated by traditional payment networks such as SWIFT and Visa, however these incumbents are facing increasing pressure as stablecoins gain regulatory traction (e.g., recent MiCA compliance achieved by Circle&amp;rsquo;s USDC and EURC in Europe). Traditional systems are burdened by high costs and slow processing times, especially for international transactions. Stablecoins offer lower transaction costs&amp;mdash;ranging from 0.5% to 3.0%&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; on average compared to the 6.4%&lt;sup&gt;14, 15&lt;/sup&gt; average for sending for international remittances via conventional channels&amp;mdash;and faster settlements. Cross-border B2B transactions using stablecoins, while still small at $843mm in 2023, are projected to rise to $1.2bn in 2024&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;, illustrating the growing adoption of stablecoins in real-world use cases. Stablecoin transaction volumes in Q2 2024 was at $6.5T, up over 200% from Q2 2023&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins are not only gaining transaction volume but are also being integrated into major financial systems, as seen with Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal launching their own stablecoin initiatives. However, for stablecoins to achieve mainstream adoption, the industry must address regulatory challenges and build consumer trust. In the US, there are two bills currently outstanding in the House and Senate, respectively: the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023 (CPSA23) and the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act (LGPSA). We will surely keep you abreast of legislative developments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Solana Flips Ether&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In July, SOL outperformed both BTC and ETH (see Exhibit 3 below), driven by a surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes on Solana. Notably, Solana&#39;s monthly DEX volumes surpassed those of ETH for the first time in July.&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: BTC / ETH / SOL Price Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;BTC/ ETH / SOL Price Performance\&quot; title=\&quot;BTC/ ETH / SOL Price Performance\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1723763565-figure-markets-btc-eth-sol-price-performance.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recent performance of SOL appears to be largely influenced by the Solana meme coin creator dApp, Pump.fun, which launched in January 2024. Since then, over 90%+ (see Exhibit 4) of all new Solana token pairs have been memecoins created on Pump.fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: Solana Dex New Tokens By Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;Solana Dex New Tokens By Project\&quot; title=\&quot;Solana Dex New Tokens By Project\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1723763570-solana-dex-new-tokens-by-project.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Typically, as fundamentally driven value investors, we would snub our nose to such tomfoolery. However, the recent activity on-chain has led transaction fees on Solana to spike, causing validator yields to rise as high as 8%&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; in July - a notable level compared to the background of nominal rates falling in the US.

The agreement supplies Core Scientific with ~15 EH/s of hashrate, representing ~2.5%&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the total Bitcoin Network (&amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo;) hashrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Political Tailwinds&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since our last missive, we believe several political developments have contributed to a ~8%&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; rally in BTC price.&amp;nbsp; First and most important is the US Presidential election.&amp;nbsp; A poor performance by President Biden in the first Presidential debate, followed by a failed assassination attempt on former President Trump, has led to a surge of Trump support. Trump&amp;rsquo;s polling average is at 42.3% compared to Biden&amp;rsquo;s 40.8%&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; while Polymarket has Trump&amp;rsquo;s chance of winning at 72% against Biden&amp;rsquo;s 19%&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Endorsements from notable figures such as Elon Musk and Bill Ackman further support the &amp;ldquo;Trump Trade&amp;rdquo; in the markets, which consists of three pillars based on Trump&#39;s past term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;More protectionist policies, which are decisively inflationary&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;Increased spending / larger deficits and lower rates, i.e., fiat money debasement&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;A more lenient / crypto-friendly regulatory environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confirming the &amp;ldquo;Trump Trade&amp;rdquo; as crypto-friendly was the announcement of JD Vance as the Vice Presidential candidate.&amp;nbsp; Vance has disclosed more than $100,000 in Bitcoin holdings&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, is circulating a draft Senate legislation that is reportedly more crypto-friendly than the House&amp;rsquo;s FIT21&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and has opposed anti-crypto legislation in the past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s recent reversal of what is commonly known as the Chevron deference bodes well for the crypto industry. The Chevron deference&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; refers to case law from 1984, where the court ruled in a case involving Chevron (yes, the oil company) that government entities tasked with regulating an industry have broad power to interpret any ambiguity in the actual statues as opposed to having the courts clarify that ambiguity. Obviously the most ambiguous industry with respect to regulation has clearly been crypto and the SEC has been relying on this precedent to carry out much of its &amp;ldquo;regulation by enforcement&amp;rdquo; campaign.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the long awaited ETH ETF launched on July 23rd. We have written about implications in past commentary which you can find &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/markets-on-markets-v1/\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Rally on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX CFTC Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realize how ubiquitous FTX exposure was in the industry and how many of our readers were adversely affected.&amp;nbsp; So we continue to report on the bankruptcy to better inform everyone no matter what their position is with respect to the case.&amp;nbsp; We know that wading through a court docket with 20,000+ filings can be overwhelming, do not worry, here are our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 7/12/2024, FTX and CFTC reached a settlement, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing FTX bankruptcy proceedings. The CFTC was the largest and single most significant creditor of&amp;nbsp; FTX with ~$52bn of claims for restitution, disgorgement and civil monetary penalties&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. The estate&amp;rsquo;s recovery projections in its proposed Chapter 11 Plan (&amp;ldquo;Plan&amp;rdquo;) is predicated on a CFTC settlement with terms similar to those reached with the IRS. Without the settlement, customer recoveries would have been significantly impacted and limited to par plus accrued interest at the claim value at time of petition&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (you can check out our memo &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/markets-on-markets-v1/\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; describing how disingenuous a &amp;ldquo;par&amp;rdquo; recovery is vs. the rally in crypto). Under the settlement, the CFTC agreed to reduce its disgorgement claim to $4bn&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and, more importantly, provide any recoveries on this claim to US Customer Entitlement Claims, Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims, Digital Asset Loan Claims, and Digital Markets Customer Entitlement Claims for supplemental payments (additional customer recoveries) via a Supplemental Remission Fund on a prorata basis. The CFTC settlement along with recent IRS settlement&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; resolve the largest hurdles in achieving estimated customer recoveries per the Plan and is a major win for creditors. The settlement becomes effective only upon the confirmation of the Estate&amp;rsquo;s proposed Chapter 11 Plan.&amp;nbsp; Important dates to note are &lt;b&gt;8/16/2024 &lt;/b&gt;(the voting deadline), &lt;b&gt;10/7/2024&lt;/b&gt; (deadline for the court to approve the Plan), and &lt;b&gt;10/30/2024&lt;/b&gt; (assumed effective date).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A new ASIC provider to the mining industry is just a chip off the Block&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Block, Inc., the payments company leaning into Bitcoin, produced and sold its first ASIC&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; machine to customer Core Scientific.&amp;nbsp; The agreement supplies Core Scientific with ~15 EH/s of hashrate, representing ~2.5%&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of the total Bitcoin Network (&amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo;) hashrate. The new machines will use 3nm chips, leapfrogging the competition that currently uses 5nm chips&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, thanks to a partnership with a &amp;ldquo;leading foundry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This development is significant not only because it introduces a new entrant into the ASIC market, adding to the competition and decentralization of the Network, but also because it is an American company leading the design.&amp;nbsp; Currently, a very small number of Chinese companies (e.g, Bitmain, Whatsminer, etc.) have near or total control over the distribution of all hash power, a situation that would not sit well under a Trump administration (see above on tariffs).&amp;nbsp; Overconcentration of hash power from a few manufacturers is also problematic for a network that is supposed to be decentralized. Risks could include ASICs potentially containing hidden malware and hardware bugs, among others. Additionally, without a competitive ASIC market, these few firms become price makers and wield undue influence on who has access to hash power. Miner fleets are constantly being upgraded to keep up with mining difficulty (hash rate is up 6x since 2021&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;). Although we do not have the specs for the new miner, we assume it is more efficient than the outstanding fleet given its 3nm chip.&amp;nbsp; More efficient miners being installed lead to higher hash rates and higher hash rates have historically had a strong correlation with price. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Bitcoin Network Hashrate vs. Bitcoin Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1722017866-figure-markets-bitcoin-network-hashrate-vs-bitcoin-price.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if only NVIDIA would make an ASIC chip for BTC mining...&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-26T19:24:33+01:00&quot;]}],&quot;relatedResources&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/bitcoin-ai-housing&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know | Figure Markets on Markets&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing - The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Mike Abbate, Chief Investment Officer, and Jesse Yuan, Senior Research Analyst&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Bitcoin selling pressure overstated\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Over the last two weeks, the price of bitcoin, along with the tech heavy NASDAQ composite, declined after Federal Reserve officials &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-inflation-prices-interest-rates-cuts-4384e6b128915458aba2d178bf31ee1b\&quot;&gt;signaled&lt;/a&gt; to the market that they anticipate only one interest-rate cut for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;As the interest in AI remains at fever pitch, we call attention to the less advertised dilemma for the AI industry; where to plug in the computers to train the AI models.&amp;nbsp; The AI industry has much to learn from the bitcoin mining industry in this respect and we see an eventual alignment of the two technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Housing prices hit all-time highs&lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The housing market is experiencing unprecedented price increases&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; due to a severe supply-demand imbalance which we expect to continue.

The first being the obvious jawboning from Fed officials after their June meeting to walk back rate cuts later this year. Given the Feds historical performance, we do not give much credence to any of their projections.&amp;nbsp; Below is the chart from three years ago, with their prediction for rates in 2024.&amp;nbsp; As Lloyd Christmas once said, &amp;ldquo;I was way off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of June 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955171-fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of December 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955290-june_fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, after years of shifting deadlines, Mt. Gox, a former bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20240624_announcement_en.pdf\&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on June 24, 2024, that it would begin repayments to creditors starting in July, 2024. Bitcoin prices immediately dropped due to anticipated selling pressure following the repayments. Although it is unclear how much Mt. Gox will distribute to customers, Mt. Gox &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1JbezDVd9VsK9o1Ga9UqLydeuEvhKLAPs6\&quot;&gt;transferred&lt;/a&gt; around 142,000 bitcoin (or ~$8.8bn&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) to an unknown wallet last week, possibly as part of the plan to repay creditors. We expect many of the creditors will likely monetize their repayments since their bitcoin was acquired at a relatively low cost basis (bitcoin was priced ~$300&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; at the end of 2014). We believe selling pressure may be overstated though - assuming all of the transferred $8.8bn bitcoin is monetized, it only represents &amp;lt;1% of total monthly trading volumes. Some rough math based on trading statistics&amp;nbsp; from May:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Bitcoin May Trading Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Instrument&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;5/24 Trading Volumes&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC perps &amp;amp; futures&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1.53tn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC options&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$50.2bn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC spot&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$41bn&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC ETF&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$250mm&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1.62tn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Conclusion: even if all $8.8bn of bitcoin is sold, the selling pressure is a drop in a bucket given the global liquidity of bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going beyond disproving bearish technicals, it is worth highlighting the bullish ones.&amp;nbsp; Historically, supply and demand mechanics are favorable following halving events, which we just experienced in April. Bitcoin prices experienced significant run ups of approximately 10x, 2x, and 7x in each of the last three halvings&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, VanEck&amp;rsquo;s filing on June 27, 2024 to sell shares in a SOL ETF resulted in an immediate surge in the price of SOL, rising from $136 to a peak of $149. However, we are skeptical of approval under the current administration due to the SEC&#39;s stance that SOL is a security in its &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf\&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Binance last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do AI models and Bitcoin miners have in common? More than most people realize. Both rely heavily on data centers, which require two basic commodities: computer chips and electricity. Globally, the number of data centers has surged to over 7,000, up from 3,600 in 2015&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. This trend has caused expectations of power demand in the US to grow by 40% over the next two decades, compared to just 9% growth over the past 20 years&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, data centers are located near low-cost, renewable energy sources.&amp;nbsp; However, the cheapest electricity is typically located in remote areas, making it less than ideal for more traditional data centers due to latency concerns. Additionally, the lowest-cost, baseload sources of energy cannot not be easily turned on or off which does not deal well with fluctuating demand.&amp;nbsp; Finally, renewable energy tends to be intermittent; the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin miners have had to deal with these issues and have done so successfully by employing demand response programs: mining when energy demand is low and shutting down when demand is high. The added benefit is this load balancing uses otherwise wasted energy and helps stabilize energy grids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AI providers are facing the same difficulties and finding great value in partnering with bitcoin miners to leverage their infrastructure and expertise. Many pure-play Bitcoin miners are expanding into or partnering with high-power compute service providers. For example, Core Scientific &lt;a href=\&quot;https://investors.corescientific.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/78/core-scientific-announces-new-contract-with-coreweave-for-delivery-of-approximately-70-mw-of-additional-infrastructure-to-host-high-performance-computing-operations\&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a 12-year, $3.5bn contract to procure over 270 MW of power dedicated to AI training with CoreWeave. Hut 8 &lt;a href=\&quot;https://hut8.com/2024/06/24/hut-8-announces-150-million-strategic-investment-from-coatue-to-partner-in-building-next-generation-ai-infrastructure-platform/\&quot;&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; a $150mm investment from Coatue to develop next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this trend will continue, with renewable data centers and baseload generators paired with AI training and Bitcoin mining operations, optimizing energy use by training or mining when power prices are low and supplying power to the grid when prices are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Housing prices hit all time high&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p classname=\&quot;text-center py-4\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&quot;Buy land, they are not making any more of it\&quot; - Mark Twain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Realtors &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-edged-lower-by-0-7-in-may-as-median-sales-price-reached-record-high-of-419300\&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in May that median housing prices reached its all-time highs in the face of the highest rates in 25 years. How could this be? The answer is simple: supply and demand.&amp;nbsp; In the US, there is a cumulative housing gap of ~6.8mm homes and homeowner mobility is at all-time lows due to relatively low-rates on existing mortgages coupled with concurrent rise in aforementioned financing costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: Housing Supply and Demand Mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955923-housing_mismatch.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: Low Homeowner Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955952-market-commentary.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are constantly looking for the common themes that tie real assets to digitally native assets on decentralized blockchains: scarcity is one of our favorites.

Currently, these ETFs hold over $59bn or 835k BTC, representing nearly 8% of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s active supply&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This follows the April halving, which reduced BTC&amp;rsquo;s yearly supply from 328,500 to 164,250.&amp;nbsp; The wrinkle worth noting when comparing BTC and ETH ETFs revolves around staking. Certain issuers such as Fidelity and Franklin Templeton have removed staking from the ETH ETFs due to regulatory pressures. &lt;b&gt;Spot ETH ETFs that omit staking will have an increased opportunity cost of holding ETH through an ETF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhibit 1: Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Ticker&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Total Flows&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;June 3 AUM&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Seed Capital&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;IBIT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,669.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20,146.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$10.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;FBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$8,977.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$11,418.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BITB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,984.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,555.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$200.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ARKB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,490&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$3,270.6&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.4&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCO&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$318.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$504.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$5.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BRRR&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$511.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$592.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;EZBC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$362.0&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$424.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.6&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;HODL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$524.1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$691.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$72.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCW&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$70.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$89.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;GBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;-$17,875.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$19,712.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$28,581.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total Net Flow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$14,032.6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$59,406.8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$28,894.7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we at the end of the short term bull market or somewhere in the middle? The MVRV ratio would suggest the latter.&amp;nbsp; Many traders look at what is called the MVRV ratio as an indication of bull and bear markets.&amp;nbsp; MVRV measures the current market cap of a token over the last traded price of a token. Historically, buy signals exist when the ratio approaches one (not many people have trading gains to monetize), and sell signals appear when the ratio trends above three (an indication most people are buying the local highs). At the end of May 2024, MVRV for ETH was 2.12&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, pretty much smack in the middle of the historical buy / sell range.&amp;nbsp; We believe that MVRV will continue to rise as spot ETFs purchases move tokens &amp;ldquo;off exchange&amp;rdquo; while token supply has generally been deflationary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: BTC and ETH MVRV&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718642911-btc_and_eth_mvrv.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Circulating ETH Supply&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718640654-eth_supply.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX Claims&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FTX estate released its much anticipated Chapter 11 Plan with an expected effective date of 10/31/24. FTX holds nearly $9.9bn in cash and $1.4bn in digital assets (digital assets are marked at petition prices) as of 4/30/24&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. During the month, FTX received payments for their Anthropic sale of $884mm&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. An additional $2.7bn in cash is expected to be received from the monetization of assets before the end of October, bringing the total estimated cash to ~$12.6bn. After the effective date, another $2.5bn to $4.3bn of assets are expected to be monetized for cash. In total, the estate expects to have &lt;b&gt;$15.1bn to $16.9bn&lt;/b&gt; of net distributed assets.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The estate currently estimates $11.2bn of allowable claims with estimated customer recoveries, after netting out priority claims, to be between 119% and 143% (see Exhibit 4) of their Petition Date claim values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: FTX Recoveries&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Estimated Percent Recovery&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 5A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Customer&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;129% - 143%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 7A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Convenience Class&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;119%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite these seemingly strong results, it is important to note that the claim values are calculated as of petition date prices (see Exhibit 5). Therefore, if a customer had one bitcoin on the platform at filing, his / her claim would only be for $16,871 dollars not for the $70,000 dollars where bitcoin is trading today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: FTX Petition Date Prices&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Asset&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Petition Price&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,871.63&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETH&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,258.84&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16.2471144&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;USDT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.9975910&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a BTC denominated claim would need a 415% recovery for a creditor to receive a comparable amount of value back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;A creditor that had SOL on the platform would need a 1,000% recovery to break even.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers should expect to wait until at least December of 2024 or early 2025 before they receive their claim distributions, subject to completion of KYC and necessary distribution information materials. Claims volumes and prices have continued to increase as customer demand for immediate liquidity on their claims rises and buyers feel more confidence in recoveries as the estate continues to monetize its assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory and Policy Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SEC remains hawkish on the space and continues to regulate through enforcement. In May 2024, Robinhood received a &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000178387924000138/hood-20240504.htm\&quot;&gt;Wells notice&lt;/a&gt; that the SEC had made a &amp;ldquo;preliminary determination&amp;rdquo; that Robinhood had violated securities law as an unregistered securities broker. The SEC made similar allegations concerning Coinbase&amp;rsquo;s activities.&amp;nbsp; The complaint is expected to be filed in the coming months which will provide more details as to the merits of the SEC&amp;rsquo;s allegations and hopefully more clarity on which tokens the SEC thinks are securities and why.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap was also served a Wells notice alleging that the decentralized exchange (DEX) it is operating is an unregistered securities broker and unregistered exchange, and the UNI token is an investment contract.&amp;nbsp; This is an important case to watch as Uniswap has already won a class action lawsuit where Judge Katherine Polk Failla &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv02780/577791/90/0.pdf?ts=1693496494\&quot;&gt;ruled &lt;/a&gt;that Uniswap, by writing the code of the smart contract, was not a &amp;ldquo;seller&amp;rdquo; of tokens and thus not a financial intermediary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap responded&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; on 5/21/24 arguing the Protocol has facilitated over $2tn in transactions and offers significant consumer benefits by eliminating intermediaries, potentially saving American investors $12bn annually if adopted in traditional equity markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amidst these regulatory actions, the recent &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409277\&quot;&gt;passage&lt;/a&gt; of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the House represents a significant legislative development in the digital assets sector. We expect FIT21 will bring stability and clarity to the digital assets ecosystem since it provides participants with a clear process to determine which digital asset transactions are subject to the SEC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction and the CFTC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction. Specifically, the CFTC will have jurisdiction over a digital asset as a commodity if the blockchain is functional and decentralized. The bill defines decentralization as: &amp;ldquo;if, among other requirements, no person has unilateral authority to control the blockchain or its usage, and no issuer or affiliated person &lt;b&gt;has control of 20 percent or more of the digital asset or the voting power of the digital asset.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the robust support from 71 Democrats, exceeding expectations, the bill faces considerable hurdles in the Senate. The lack of a Senate companion bill, a tight congressional schedule, and substantial opposition from key figures like Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, make its enactment this year unlikely. Although FIT21 is unlikely to be addressed in the Senate this year, it could lay the groundwork for future legislative efforts post-election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-17T17:20:35+01:00&quot;]}]}],[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything You Need to Know About Crypto Loans&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Learn how crypto currency loans work, their benefits, how to get a crypto loan, and how to borrow against your crypto.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything you need to know about Crypto Loans&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets Research Group&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;The world of crypto is constantly evolving, going far beyond just buying and selling digital assets. One exciting development is the rise of crypto loans, also known as cryptocurrency loans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a crypto loan, you can borrow a traditional currency (like USD or EUR) or a stablecoin (like USDC) by using your cryptocurrency as collateral just like you would use other assets - like a house or a car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This concept brings more flexibility and a unique opportunity to leverage existing crypto assets to secure financing. But how exactly do crypto loans work? What are the benefits and risks involved? And how do crypto loans compare to traditional loans?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned crypto user or just exploring the possibilities, this guide will help you understand everything you need to know about how crypto loans work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Want to explore the world of crypto-backed loans at your own pace?

But don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;re here to help. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the most common terms you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter, making it simple and straightforward for you to understand how crypto loans work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;Crypto lending glossary\&quot; title=\&quot;Crypto lending glossery\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642575-crypto-lending-glossary.png\&quot; width=\&quot;772\&quot; height=\&quot;1264\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve familiarized yourself with the most common crypto lending terms, let&amp;rsquo;s understand what crypto-backed loans are and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A crypto loan is a type of secured loan in which you pledge digital assets as collateral to receive a loan in fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR, BRL) or stablecoins (e.g. USDC, USDT). It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a traditional secured loan, like a mortgage or a car loan, in which the asset acts as a security for the lender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How are crypto loans different from traditional loans?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans that typically require credit checks and extensive paperwork, crypto loans offer a more streamlined and accessible lending process:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No credit checks: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans do not require credit checks. The collateral itself reduces the lender&amp;rsquo;s risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faster approval: &lt;/b&gt;The process is usually fast and straightforward, with funds often available quickly.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency: &lt;/b&gt;Some crypto loans leverage blockchain technology, offering a decentralized and transparent process that eliminates many of the inefficiencies of conventional banking systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tax benefits: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans may provide some borrowers with certain tax benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Types of crypto loans&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cryptocurrency loans: CeFi and DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Centralized finance (CeFi) loans are crypto loans offered by centralized institutions or platforms. Similar to traditional loans, they may be easier to use but require trusting a central entity with your crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642854-cefi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance (DeFi) loans are cryptocurrency loans managed by smart contracts on a blockchain network, which means no intermediaries. They offer greater transparency, accessibility and, often, lower fees, but come with higher risk and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642863-defi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing between CeFi and DeFi for crypto loans depends on your preference. CeFi offers ease of use, compliance, and customer support, but at the cost of higher fees and less control. DeFi provides greater control, transparency, and potentially lower fees, but requires technical know-how and carries higher security risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How to get a crypto loan&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to take out a crypto-backed loan, each offering unique advantages to suit different needs. You can choose centralized finance (CeFi) platforms for straightforward, secure loans, or explore decentralized finance (DeFi) options for greater control but require greater technical knowledge to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a general overview on how to take out loans on each type of platform. For more specifics, please refer to the specific platform&amp;rsquo;s instructions on their respective websites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a CeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Create an account on a CeFi platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Send collateral&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Borrow funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a DeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Set up a crypto wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2. Install and configure wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Transfer the crypto assets you plan to use as collateral to your wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Connect to DeFi lending platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Deposit collateral&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Borrow Funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking out a DeFi crypto loan generally requires more constant monitoring compared to CeFi loans due to the nature of smart contracts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, smart contracts are programmed to automatically liquidate collateral if certain conditions, such as a LTV ratio, are met. This automation ensures prompt action but also means that borrowers must vigilantly track the value of their collateral and market conditions to avoid sudden liquidation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike CeFi crypto loans, where there might be more flexibility and time to respond to margin calls, DeFi loans generally offer no such leniency, making continuous monitoring essential to manage the risk of automatic liquidation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest rates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DeFi crypto loans often come with variable interest rates, which are generally determined based on market demand and supply conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans with fixed rates, DeFi loan rates are determined by algorithms within smart contracts that adjust in real time. This variability can lead to opportunities for lower interest payments during periods of high liquidity but also carries the risk of rising rates during times of increased borrowing demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must be aware of these fluctuations and manage your loans accordingly, as the dynamic nature of DeFi interest rates can impact the overall cost and feasibility of maintaining your positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Taking it all in? Download the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&quot;/Figure-Markets-The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Crypto-Backed-Loans.pdf\&quot;&gt;Ultimate Guide to Crypto-Backed Loans&lt;/a&gt; and have it at your fingertips for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Crypto loans and margin calls&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One critical aspect of crypto loans is the risk of margin calls. If the value of your crypto collateral drops significantly, the lender may issue a margin call and require you to deposit additional collateral to maintain the agreed LTV ratio. If you fail to do so, they might liquidate your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all lenders issue margin calls, and in some cases, collateral may be automatically liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes down in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin falls to $20,000, the value of your collateral decreases to $20,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio increases to 50%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has dropped. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643144-crypto-collateral-value-decrease.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An increase in the LTV ratio indicates higher risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth less relative to the loan amount. If the LTV ratio exceeds a certain threshold, such as 70-80%, the lender may issue a margin call, requiring you to add more collateral or repay part of the loan. Failure to meet the margin call could result in the lender liquidating your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes up in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin rises to $50,000, the value of your collateral increases to $50,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio decreases to 20%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has increased. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643110-crypto-collateral-value-increase.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A decrease in the LTV ratio indicates lower risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth more relative to the loan amount. This increased security reduces the likelihood of a margin call or the need for additional collateral. Additionally, you may be eligible to borrow more funds against the increased value of your Bitcoin collateral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What are the U.S. federal tax implications of taking out a crypto-backed loan?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When considering taking out a crypto-backed loan in the United States, it&#39;s important to understand the potential tax implications. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of key considerations. This is not tax, legal, or investment advice, and applicable tax rules and guidance are subject to change, please consult with tax professional:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Receiving the loan&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, receiving proceeds from a loan, including a crypto-backed loan, is not considered a taxable event. You do not incur a tax liability on the loan amount received when you open the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest payments&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interest payments on a crypto-backed loan may or may not be deductible. If the loan is used for investment purposes, the interest may qualify as a deductible expense. However, if the loan is used for personal purposes, the interest is typically not deductible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Collateral liquidation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;If your collateral is liquidated to repay the loan, this triggers a taxable event. You may owe capital gains tax if the value of the cryptocurrency has increased since your purchase date. The gain is generally calculated based on the difference between the sale price of an asset and its cost basis (generally, the original purchase price plus acquisition costs).&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;The tax rate depends on how long you held the asset before it was liquidated. If held for more than a year, the gain may&amp;nbsp; qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower than short-term rates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan repayment&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repaying the principal amount of the loan using cash (i.e., fiat) is generally not a taxable event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Reporting requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any gains from the liquidation of collateral must be reported on your tax return.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you need cash to cover unexpected expenses, for an investment opportunity, or to diversify your portfolio, a crypto-backed loan can provide the financial flexibility you need while keeping your crypto holdings intact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto-backed loans often come with lower interest rates compared to traditional unsecured loans, and they typically don&amp;rsquo;t require credit checks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of getting a crypto-backed loan? &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/borrow/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=cta-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ultimate-guide\&quot;&gt;Apply today&lt;/a&gt; at Figure Markets!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything you need to know about crypto loans&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1501],&quot;width&quot;:[0,4800]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-10T21:47:05+01:00&quot;]}]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-10T21:47:05+01:00&quot;],&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;]}],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Learn how crypto currency loans work, their benefits, how to get a crypto loan, and how to borrow against your crypto.&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything You Need to Know About Crypto Loans&quot;]}],&quot;multipleBlockContent&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;disclaimerGroup&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets on Markets Vol 2&quot;],&quot;disclaimerType&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets on Markets v2 sources&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;1.

One exciting development is the rise of crypto loans, also known as cryptocurrency loans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a crypto loan, you can borrow a traditional currency (like USD or EUR) or a stablecoin (like USDC) by using your cryptocurrency as collateral just like you would use other assets - like a house or a car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This concept brings more flexibility and a unique opportunity to leverage existing crypto assets to secure financing. But how exactly do crypto loans work? What are the benefits and risks involved? And how do crypto loans compare to traditional loans?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned crypto user or just exploring the possibilities, this guide will help you understand everything you need to know about how crypto loans work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Want to explore the world of crypto-backed loans at your own pace?

But don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;re here to help. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the most common terms you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter, making it simple and straightforward for you to understand how crypto loans work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;Crypto lending glossary\&quot; title=\&quot;Crypto lending glossery\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642575-crypto-lending-glossary.png\&quot; width=\&quot;772\&quot; height=\&quot;1264\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve familiarized yourself with the most common crypto lending terms, let&amp;rsquo;s understand what crypto-backed loans are and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A crypto loan is a type of secured loan in which you pledge digital assets as collateral to receive a loan in fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR, BRL) or stablecoins (e.g. USDC, USDT). It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a traditional secured loan, like a mortgage or a car loan, in which the asset acts as a security for the lender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How are crypto loans different from traditional loans?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans that typically require credit checks and extensive paperwork, crypto loans offer a more streamlined and accessible lending process:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No credit checks: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans do not require credit checks. The collateral itself reduces the lender&amp;rsquo;s risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faster approval: &lt;/b&gt;The process is usually fast and straightforward, with funds often available quickly.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency: &lt;/b&gt;Some crypto loans leverage blockchain technology, offering a decentralized and transparent process that eliminates many of the inefficiencies of conventional banking systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tax benefits: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans may provide some borrowers with certain tax benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Types of crypto loans&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cryptocurrency loans: CeFi and DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Centralized finance (CeFi) loans are crypto loans offered by centralized institutions or platforms. Similar to traditional loans, they may be easier to use but require trusting a central entity with your crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642854-cefi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance (DeFi) loans are cryptocurrency loans managed by smart contracts on a blockchain network, which means no intermediaries. They offer greater transparency, accessibility and, often, lower fees, but come with higher risk and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642863-defi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing between CeFi and DeFi for crypto loans depends on your preference. CeFi offers ease of use, compliance, and customer support, but at the cost of higher fees and less control. DeFi provides greater control, transparency, and potentially lower fees, but requires technical know-how and carries higher security risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How to get a crypto loan&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to take out a crypto-backed loan, each offering unique advantages to suit different needs. You can choose centralized finance (CeFi) platforms for straightforward, secure loans, or explore decentralized finance (DeFi) options for greater control but require greater technical knowledge to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a general overview on how to take out loans on each type of platform. For more specifics, please refer to the specific platform&amp;rsquo;s instructions on their respective websites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a CeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Create an account on a CeFi platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Send collateral&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Borrow funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a DeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Set up a crypto wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2. Install and configure wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Transfer the crypto assets you plan to use as collateral to your wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Connect to DeFi lending platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Deposit collateral&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Borrow Funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking out a DeFi crypto loan generally requires more constant monitoring compared to CeFi loans due to the nature of smart contracts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, smart contracts are programmed to automatically liquidate collateral if certain conditions, such as a LTV ratio, are met. This automation ensures prompt action but also means that borrowers must vigilantly track the value of their collateral and market conditions to avoid sudden liquidation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike CeFi crypto loans, where there might be more flexibility and time to respond to margin calls, DeFi loans generally offer no such leniency, making continuous monitoring essential to manage the risk of automatic liquidation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest rates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DeFi crypto loans often come with variable interest rates, which are generally determined based on market demand and supply conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans with fixed rates, DeFi loan rates are determined by algorithms within smart contracts that adjust in real time. This variability can lead to opportunities for lower interest payments during periods of high liquidity but also carries the risk of rising rates during times of increased borrowing demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must be aware of these fluctuations and manage your loans accordingly, as the dynamic nature of DeFi interest rates can impact the overall cost and feasibility of maintaining your positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Taking it all in?

If the value of your crypto collateral drops significantly, the lender may issue a margin call and require you to deposit additional collateral to maintain the agreed LTV ratio. If you fail to do so, they might liquidate your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all lenders issue margin calls, and in some cases, collateral may be automatically liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes down in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin falls to $20,000, the value of your collateral decreases to $20,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio increases to 50%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has dropped. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643144-crypto-collateral-value-decrease.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An increase in the LTV ratio indicates higher risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth less relative to the loan amount. If the LTV ratio exceeds a certain threshold, such as 70-80%, the lender may issue a margin call, requiring you to add more collateral or repay part of the loan. Failure to meet the margin call could result in the lender liquidating your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes up in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin rises to $50,000, the value of your collateral increases to $50,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio decreases to 20%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has increased. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643110-crypto-collateral-value-increase.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A decrease in the LTV ratio indicates lower risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth more relative to the loan amount. This increased security reduces the likelihood of a margin call or the need for additional collateral. Additionally, you may be eligible to borrow more funds against the increased value of your Bitcoin collateral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What are the U.S. federal tax implications of taking out a crypto-backed loan?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When considering taking out a crypto-backed loan in the United States, it&#39;s important to understand the potential tax implications. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of key considerations. This is not tax, legal, or investment advice, and applicable tax rules and guidance are subject to change, please consult with tax professional:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Receiving the loan&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, receiving proceeds from a loan, including a crypto-backed loan, is not considered a taxable event. You do not incur a tax liability on the loan amount received when you open the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest payments&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interest payments on a crypto-backed loan may or may not be deductible. If the loan is used for investment purposes, the interest may qualify as a deductible expense. However, if the loan is used for personal purposes, the interest is typically not deductible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Collateral liquidation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;If your collateral is liquidated to repay the loan, this triggers a taxable event. You may owe capital gains tax if the value of the cryptocurrency has increased since your purchase date. The gain is generally calculated based on the difference between the sale price of an asset and its cost basis (generally, the original purchase price plus acquisition costs).&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;The tax rate depends on how long you held the asset before it was liquidated. If held for more than a year, the gain may&amp;nbsp; qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower than short-term rates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan repayment&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repaying the principal amount of the loan using cash (i.e., fiat) is generally not a taxable event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Reporting requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any gains from the liquidation of collateral must be reported on your tax return.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you need cash to cover unexpected expenses, for an investment opportunity, or to diversify your portfolio, a crypto-backed loan can provide the financial flexibility you need while keeping your crypto holdings intact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto-backed loans often come with lower interest rates compared to traditional unsecured loans, and they typically don&amp;rsquo;t require credit checks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of getting a crypto-backed loan? &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/borrow/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=cta-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ultimate-guide\&quot;&gt;Apply today&lt;/a&gt; at Figure Markets!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything you need to know about crypto loans&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1501],&quot;width&quot;:[0,4800]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-10T21:47:05+01:00&quot;]}],&quot;relatedResources&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;political-shifts-ftx-cftc-settlement-and-blocks-asic-breakthrough&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Political Shifts, FTX &amp; CFTC Settlement, and Block&#39;s ASIC Breakthrough.

The agreement supplies Core Scientific with ~15 EH/s of hashrate, representing ~2.5%&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the total Bitcoin Network (&amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo;) hashrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Political Tailwinds&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since our last missive, we believe several political developments have contributed to a ~8%&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; rally in BTC price.&amp;nbsp; First and most important is the US Presidential election.&amp;nbsp; A poor performance by President Biden in the first Presidential debate, followed by a failed assassination attempt on former President Trump, has led to a surge of Trump support. Trump&amp;rsquo;s polling average is at 42.3% compared to Biden&amp;rsquo;s 40.8%&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; while Polymarket has Trump&amp;rsquo;s chance of winning at 72% against Biden&amp;rsquo;s 19%&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Endorsements from notable figures such as Elon Musk and Bill Ackman further support the &amp;ldquo;Trump Trade&amp;rdquo; in the markets, which consists of three pillars based on Trump&#39;s past term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;More protectionist policies, which are decisively inflationary&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;Increased spending / larger deficits and lower rates, i.e., fiat money debasement&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;A more lenient / crypto-friendly regulatory environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confirming the &amp;ldquo;Trump Trade&amp;rdquo; as crypto-friendly was the announcement of JD Vance as the Vice Presidential candidate.&amp;nbsp; Vance has disclosed more than $100,000 in Bitcoin holdings&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, is circulating a draft Senate legislation that is reportedly more crypto-friendly than the House&amp;rsquo;s FIT21&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and has opposed anti-crypto legislation in the past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s recent reversal of what is commonly known as the Chevron deference bodes well for the crypto industry. The Chevron deference&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; refers to case law from 1984, where the court ruled in a case involving Chevron (yes, the oil company) that government entities tasked with regulating an industry have broad power to interpret any ambiguity in the actual statues as opposed to having the courts clarify that ambiguity. Obviously the most ambiguous industry with respect to regulation has clearly been crypto and the SEC has been relying on this precedent to carry out much of its &amp;ldquo;regulation by enforcement&amp;rdquo; campaign.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the long awaited ETH ETF launched on July 23rd. We have written about implications in past commentary which you can find &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/markets-on-markets-v1/\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Rally on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX CFTC Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realize how ubiquitous FTX exposure was in the industry and how many of our readers were adversely affected.&amp;nbsp; So we continue to report on the bankruptcy to better inform everyone no matter what their position is with respect to the case.&amp;nbsp; We know that wading through a court docket with 20,000+ filings can be overwhelming, do not worry, here are our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 7/12/2024, FTX and CFTC reached a settlement, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing FTX bankruptcy proceedings. The CFTC was the largest and single most significant creditor of&amp;nbsp; FTX with ~$52bn of claims for restitution, disgorgement and civil monetary penalties&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. The estate&amp;rsquo;s recovery projections in its proposed Chapter 11 Plan (&amp;ldquo;Plan&amp;rdquo;) is predicated on a CFTC settlement with terms similar to those reached with the IRS. Without the settlement, customer recoveries would have been significantly impacted and limited to par plus accrued interest at the claim value at time of petition&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (you can check out our memo &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/markets-on-markets-v1/\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; describing how disingenuous a &amp;ldquo;par&amp;rdquo; recovery is vs. the rally in crypto). Under the settlement, the CFTC agreed to reduce its disgorgement claim to $4bn&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and, more importantly, provide any recoveries on this claim to US Customer Entitlement Claims, Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims, Digital Asset Loan Claims, and Digital Markets Customer Entitlement Claims for supplemental payments (additional customer recoveries) via a Supplemental Remission Fund on a prorata basis. The CFTC settlement along with recent IRS settlement&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; resolve the largest hurdles in achieving estimated customer recoveries per the Plan and is a major win for creditors. The settlement becomes effective only upon the confirmation of the Estate&amp;rsquo;s proposed Chapter 11 Plan.&amp;nbsp; Important dates to note are &lt;b&gt;8/16/2024 &lt;/b&gt;(the voting deadline), &lt;b&gt;10/7/2024&lt;/b&gt; (deadline for the court to approve the Plan), and &lt;b&gt;10/30/2024&lt;/b&gt; (assumed effective date).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A new ASIC provider to the mining industry is just a chip off the Block&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Block, Inc., the payments company leaning into Bitcoin, produced and sold its first ASIC&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; machine to customer Core Scientific.&amp;nbsp; The agreement supplies Core Scientific with ~15 EH/s of hashrate, representing ~2.5%&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of the total Bitcoin Network (&amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo;) hashrate. The new machines will use 3nm chips, leapfrogging the competition that currently uses 5nm chips&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, thanks to a partnership with a &amp;ldquo;leading foundry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This development is significant not only because it introduces a new entrant into the ASIC market, adding to the competition and decentralization of the Network, but also because it is an American company leading the design.&amp;nbsp; Currently, a very small number of Chinese companies (e.g, Bitmain, Whatsminer, etc.) have near or total control over the distribution of all hash power, a situation that would not sit well under a Trump administration (see above on tariffs).&amp;nbsp; Overconcentration of hash power from a few manufacturers is also problematic for a network that is supposed to be decentralized. Risks could include ASICs potentially containing hidden malware and hardware bugs, among others. Additionally, without a competitive ASIC market, these few firms become price makers and wield undue influence on who has access to hash power. Miner fleets are constantly being upgraded to keep up with mining difficulty (hash rate is up 6x since 2021&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;). Although we do not have the specs for the new miner, we assume it is more efficient than the outstanding fleet given its 3nm chip.&amp;nbsp; More efficient miners being installed lead to higher hash rates and higher hash rates have historically had a strong correlation with price. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Bitcoin Network Hashrate vs. Bitcoin Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1722017866-figure-markets-bitcoin-network-hashrate-vs-bitcoin-price.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if only NVIDIA would make an ASIC chip for BTC mining...&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-26T19:24:33+01:00&quot;]}]}],[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/bitcoin-ai-housing&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know | Figure Markets on Markets&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing - The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Mike Abbate, Chief Investment Officer, and Jesse Yuan, Senior Research Analyst&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Bitcoin selling pressure overstated\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Over the last two weeks, the price of bitcoin, along with the tech heavy NASDAQ composite, declined after Federal Reserve officials &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-inflation-prices-interest-rates-cuts-4384e6b128915458aba2d178bf31ee1b\&quot;&gt;signaled&lt;/a&gt; to the market that they anticipate only one interest-rate cut for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;As the interest in AI remains at fever pitch, we call attention to the less advertised dilemma for the AI industry; where to plug in the computers to train the AI models.&amp;nbsp; The AI industry has much to learn from the bitcoin mining industry in this respect and we see an eventual alignment of the two technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Housing prices hit all-time highs&lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The housing market is experiencing unprecedented price increases&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; due to a severe supply-demand imbalance which we expect to continue. Scarcity is a common thread that runs between the US housing market and the crypto market worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin selling pressure overstated&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it is difficult to point to any single catalyst for the selling pressure for bitcoin, we highlight two. The first being the obvious jawboning from Fed officials after their June meeting to walk back rate cuts later this year. Given the Feds historical performance, we do not give much credence to any of their projections.&amp;nbsp; Below is the chart from three years ago, with their prediction for rates in 2024.&amp;nbsp; As Lloyd Christmas once said, &amp;ldquo;I was way off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of June 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955171-fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of December 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955290-june_fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, after years of shifting deadlines, Mt. Gox, a former bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20240624_announcement_en.pdf\&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on June 24, 2024, that it would begin repayments to creditors starting in July, 2024. Bitcoin prices immediately dropped due to anticipated selling pressure following the repayments. Although it is unclear how much Mt. Gox will distribute to customers, Mt. Gox &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1JbezDVd9VsK9o1Ga9UqLydeuEvhKLAPs6\&quot;&gt;transferred&lt;/a&gt; around 142,000 bitcoin (or ~$8.8bn&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) to an unknown wallet last week, possibly as part of the plan to repay creditors. We expect many of the creditors will likely monetize their repayments since their bitcoin was acquired at a relatively low cost basis (bitcoin was priced ~$300&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; at the end of 2014). We believe selling pressure may be overstated though - assuming all of the transferred $8.8bn bitcoin is monetized, it only represents &amp;lt;1% of total monthly trading volumes. Some rough math based on trading statistics&amp;nbsp; from May:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Bitcoin May Trading Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Instrument&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;5/24 Trading Volumes&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC perps &amp;amp; futures&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1.53tn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC options&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$50.2bn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC spot&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$41bn&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC ETF&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$250mm&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1.62tn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Conclusion: even if all $8.8bn of bitcoin is sold, the selling pressure is a drop in a bucket given the global liquidity of bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going beyond disproving bearish technicals, it is worth highlighting the bullish ones.&amp;nbsp; Historically, supply and demand mechanics are favorable following halving events, which we just experienced in April. Bitcoin prices experienced significant run ups of approximately 10x, 2x, and 7x in each of the last three halvings&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, VanEck&amp;rsquo;s filing on June 27, 2024 to sell shares in a SOL ETF resulted in an immediate surge in the price of SOL, rising from $136 to a peak of $149. However, we are skeptical of approval under the current administration due to the SEC&#39;s stance that SOL is a security in its &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf\&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Binance last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do AI models and Bitcoin miners have in common? More than most people realize. Both rely heavily on data centers, which require two basic commodities: computer chips and electricity. Globally, the number of data centers has surged to over 7,000, up from 3,600 in 2015&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. This trend has caused expectations of power demand in the US to grow by 40% over the next two decades, compared to just 9% growth over the past 20 years&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, data centers are located near low-cost, renewable energy sources.&amp;nbsp; However, the cheapest electricity is typically located in remote areas, making it less than ideal for more traditional data centers due to latency concerns. Additionally, the lowest-cost, baseload sources of energy cannot not be easily turned on or off which does not deal well with fluctuating demand.&amp;nbsp; Finally, renewable energy tends to be intermittent; the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin miners have had to deal with these issues and have done so successfully by employing demand response programs: mining when energy demand is low and shutting down when demand is high. The added benefit is this load balancing uses otherwise wasted energy and helps stabilize energy grids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AI providers are facing the same difficulties and finding great value in partnering with bitcoin miners to leverage their infrastructure and expertise. Many pure-play Bitcoin miners are expanding into or partnering with high-power compute service providers. For example, Core Scientific &lt;a href=\&quot;https://investors.corescientific.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/78/core-scientific-announces-new-contract-with-coreweave-for-delivery-of-approximately-70-mw-of-additional-infrastructure-to-host-high-performance-computing-operations\&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a 12-year, $3.5bn contract to procure over 270 MW of power dedicated to AI training with CoreWeave. Hut 8 &lt;a href=\&quot;https://hut8.com/2024/06/24/hut-8-announces-150-million-strategic-investment-from-coatue-to-partner-in-building-next-generation-ai-infrastructure-platform/\&quot;&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; a $150mm investment from Coatue to develop next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this trend will continue, with renewable data centers and baseload generators paired with AI training and Bitcoin mining operations, optimizing energy use by training or mining when power prices are low and supplying power to the grid when prices are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Housing prices hit all time high&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p classname=\&quot;text-center py-4\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&quot;Buy land, they are not making any more of it\&quot; - Mark Twain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Realtors &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-edged-lower-by-0-7-in-may-as-median-sales-price-reached-record-high-of-419300\&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in May that median housing prices reached its all-time highs in the face of the highest rates in 25 years. How could this be? The answer is simple: supply and demand.&amp;nbsp; In the US, there is a cumulative housing gap of ~6.8mm homes and homeowner mobility is at all-time lows due to relatively low-rates on existing mortgages coupled with concurrent rise in aforementioned financing costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: Housing Supply and Demand Mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955923-housing_mismatch.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: Low Homeowner Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955952-market-commentary.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are constantly looking for the common themes that tie real assets to digitally native assets on decentralized blockchains: scarcity is one of our favorites.

Currently, these ETFs hold over $59bn or 835k BTC, representing nearly 8% of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s active supply&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This follows the April halving, which reduced BTC&amp;rsquo;s yearly supply from 328,500 to 164,250.&amp;nbsp; The wrinkle worth noting when comparing BTC and ETH ETFs revolves around staking. Certain issuers such as Fidelity and Franklin Templeton have removed staking from the ETH ETFs due to regulatory pressures. &lt;b&gt;Spot ETH ETFs that omit staking will have an increased opportunity cost of holding ETH through an ETF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhibit 1: Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Ticker&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Total Flows&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;June 3 AUM&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Seed Capital&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;IBIT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,669.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20,146.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$10.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;FBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$8,977.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$11,418.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BITB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,984.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,555.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$200.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ARKB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,490&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$3,270.6&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.4&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCO&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$318.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$504.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$5.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BRRR&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$511.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$592.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;EZBC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$362.0&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$424.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.6&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;HODL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$524.1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$691.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$72.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCW&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$70.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$89.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;GBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;-$17,875.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$19,712.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$28,581.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total Net Flow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$14,032.6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$59,406.8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$28,894.7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we at the end of the short term bull market or somewhere in the middle? The MVRV ratio would suggest the latter.&amp;nbsp; Many traders look at what is called the MVRV ratio as an indication of bull and bear markets.&amp;nbsp; MVRV measures the current market cap of a token over the last traded price of a token. Historically, buy signals exist when the ratio approaches one (not many people have trading gains to monetize), and sell signals appear when the ratio trends above three (an indication most people are buying the local highs). At the end of May 2024, MVRV for ETH was 2.12&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, pretty much smack in the middle of the historical buy / sell range.&amp;nbsp; We believe that MVRV will continue to rise as spot ETFs purchases move tokens &amp;ldquo;off exchange&amp;rdquo; while token supply has generally been deflationary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: BTC and ETH MVRV&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718642911-btc_and_eth_mvrv.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Circulating ETH Supply&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718640654-eth_supply.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX Claims&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FTX estate released its much anticipated Chapter 11 Plan with an expected effective date of 10/31/24. FTX holds nearly $9.9bn in cash and $1.4bn in digital assets (digital assets are marked at petition prices) as of 4/30/24&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. During the month, FTX received payments for their Anthropic sale of $884mm&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. An additional $2.7bn in cash is expected to be received from the monetization of assets before the end of October, bringing the total estimated cash to ~$12.6bn. After the effective date, another $2.5bn to $4.3bn of assets are expected to be monetized for cash. In total, the estate expects to have &lt;b&gt;$15.1bn to $16.9bn&lt;/b&gt; of net distributed assets.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The estate currently estimates $11.2bn of allowable claims with estimated customer recoveries, after netting out priority claims, to be between 119% and 143% (see Exhibit 4) of their Petition Date claim values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: FTX Recoveries&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Estimated Percent Recovery&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 5A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Customer&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;129% - 143%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 7A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Convenience Class&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;119%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite these seemingly strong results, it is important to note that the claim values are calculated as of petition date prices (see Exhibit 5). Therefore, if a customer had one bitcoin on the platform at filing, his / her claim would only be for $16,871 dollars not for the $70,000 dollars where bitcoin is trading today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: FTX Petition Date Prices&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Asset&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Petition Price&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,871.63&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETH&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,258.84&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16.2471144&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;USDT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.9975910&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a BTC denominated claim would need a 415% recovery for a creditor to receive a comparable amount of value back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;A creditor that had SOL on the platform would need a 1,000% recovery to break even.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers should expect to wait until at least December of 2024 or early 2025 before they receive their claim distributions, subject to completion of KYC and necessary distribution information materials. Claims volumes and prices have continued to increase as customer demand for immediate liquidity on their claims rises and buyers feel more confidence in recoveries as the estate continues to monetize its assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory and Policy Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SEC remains hawkish on the space and continues to regulate through enforcement. In May 2024, Robinhood received a &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000178387924000138/hood-20240504.htm\&quot;&gt;Wells notice&lt;/a&gt; that the SEC had made a &amp;ldquo;preliminary determination&amp;rdquo; that Robinhood had violated securities law as an unregistered securities broker. The SEC made similar allegations concerning Coinbase&amp;rsquo;s activities.&amp;nbsp; The complaint is expected to be filed in the coming months which will provide more details as to the merits of the SEC&amp;rsquo;s allegations and hopefully more clarity on which tokens the SEC thinks are securities and why.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap was also served a Wells notice alleging that the decentralized exchange (DEX) it is operating is an unregistered securities broker and unregistered exchange, and the UNI token is an investment contract.&amp;nbsp; This is an important case to watch as Uniswap has already won a class action lawsuit where Judge Katherine Polk Failla &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv02780/577791/90/0.pdf?ts=1693496494\&quot;&gt;ruled &lt;/a&gt;that Uniswap, by writing the code of the smart contract, was not a &amp;ldquo;seller&amp;rdquo; of tokens and thus not a financial intermediary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap responded&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; on 5/21/24 arguing the Protocol has facilitated over $2tn in transactions and offers significant consumer benefits by eliminating intermediaries, potentially saving American investors $12bn annually if adopted in traditional equity markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amidst these regulatory actions, the recent &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409277\&quot;&gt;passage&lt;/a&gt; of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the House represents a significant legislative development in the digital assets sector. We expect FIT21 will bring stability and clarity to the digital assets ecosystem since it provides participants with a clear process to determine which digital asset transactions are subject to the SEC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction and the CFTC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction. Specifically, the CFTC will have jurisdiction over a digital asset as a commodity if the blockchain is functional and decentralized. The bill defines decentralization as: &amp;ldquo;if, among other requirements, no person has unilateral authority to control the blockchain or its usage, and no issuer or affiliated person &lt;b&gt;has control of 20 percent or more of the digital asset or the voting power of the digital asset.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the robust support from 71 Democrats, exceeding expectations, the bill faces considerable hurdles in the Senate. The lack of a Senate companion bill, a tight congressional schedule, and substantial opposition from key figures like Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, make its enactment this year unlikely. Although FIT21 is unlikely to be addressed in the Senate this year, it could lay the groundwork for future legislative efforts post-election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-17T17:20:35+01:00&quot;]}]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-17T17:20:35+01:00&quot;],&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/markets-on-markets-v1&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Dive into market analysis of Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum price movements, the latest on FTX, and the potential impact of the new FIT21 Act on crypto regulations.&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets on Markets: BTC &amp; ETH Near All-Time Highs, FTX Update, New US Crypto Bill (FIT21)&quot;]}],&quot;multipleBlockContent&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;disclaimerGroup&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets on Markets Vol 1&quot;],&quot;disclaimerType&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets on Markets Vol 1 Sources&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;1.

Currently, these ETFs hold over $59bn or 835k BTC, representing nearly 8% of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s active supply&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This follows the April halving, which reduced BTC&amp;rsquo;s yearly supply from 328,500 to 164,250.&amp;nbsp; The wrinkle worth noting when comparing BTC and ETH ETFs revolves around staking. Certain issuers such as Fidelity and Franklin Templeton have removed staking from the ETH ETFs due to regulatory pressures. &lt;b&gt;Spot ETH ETFs that omit staking will have an increased opportunity cost of holding ETH through an ETF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhibit 1: Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Ticker&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Total Flows&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;June 3 AUM&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Seed Capital&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;IBIT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,669.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20,146.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$10.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;FBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$8,977.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$11,418.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BITB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,984.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,555.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$200.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ARKB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,490&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$3,270.6&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.4&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCO&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$318.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$504.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$5.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BRRR&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$511.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$592.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;EZBC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$362.0&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$424.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.6&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;HODL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$524.1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$691.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$72.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCW&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$70.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$89.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;GBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;-$17,875.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$19,712.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$28,581.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total Net Flow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$14,032.6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$59,406.8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$28,894.7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we at the end of the short term bull market or somewhere in the middle? The MVRV ratio would suggest the latter.&amp;nbsp; Many traders look at what is called the MVRV ratio as an indication of bull and bear markets.&amp;nbsp; MVRV measures the current market cap of a token over the last traded price of a token. Historically, buy signals exist when the ratio approaches one (not many people have trading gains to monetize), and sell signals appear when the ratio trends above three (an indication most people are buying the local highs). At the end of May 2024, MVRV for ETH was 2.12&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, pretty much smack in the middle of the historical buy / sell range.&amp;nbsp; We believe that MVRV will continue to rise as spot ETFs purchases move tokens &amp;ldquo;off exchange&amp;rdquo; while token supply has generally been deflationary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: BTC and ETH MVRV&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718642911-btc_and_eth_mvrv.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Circulating ETH Supply&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718640654-eth_supply.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX Claims&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FTX estate released its much anticipated Chapter 11 Plan with an expected effective date of 10/31/24. FTX holds nearly $9.9bn in cash and $1.4bn in digital assets (digital assets are marked at petition prices) as of 4/30/24&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. During the month, FTX received payments for their Anthropic sale of $884mm&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. An additional $2.7bn in cash is expected to be received from the monetization of assets before the end of October, bringing the total estimated cash to ~$12.6bn. After the effective date, another $2.5bn to $4.3bn of assets are expected to be monetized for cash. In total, the estate expects to have &lt;b&gt;$15.1bn to $16.9bn&lt;/b&gt; of net distributed assets.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The estate currently estimates $11.2bn of allowable claims with estimated customer recoveries, after netting out priority claims, to be between 119% and 143% (see Exhibit 4) of their Petition Date claim values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: FTX Recoveries&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Estimated Percent Recovery&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 5A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Customer&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;129% - 143%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 7A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Convenience Class&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;119%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite these seemingly strong results, it is important to note that the claim values are calculated as of petition date prices (see Exhibit 5). Therefore, if a customer had one bitcoin on the platform at filing, his / her claim would only be for $16,871 dollars not for the $70,000 dollars where bitcoin is trading today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: FTX Petition Date Prices&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Asset&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Petition Price&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,871.63&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETH&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,258.84&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16.2471144&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;USDT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.9975910&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a BTC denominated claim would need a 415% recovery for a creditor to receive a comparable amount of value back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;A creditor that had SOL on the platform would need a 1,000% recovery to break even.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers should expect to wait until at least December of 2024 or early 2025 before they receive their claim distributions, subject to completion of KYC and necessary distribution information materials. Claims volumes and prices have continued to increase as customer demand for immediate liquidity on their claims rises and buyers feel more confidence in recoveries as the estate continues to monetize its assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory and Policy Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SEC remains hawkish on the space and continues to regulate through enforcement. In May 2024, Robinhood received a &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000178387924000138/hood-20240504.htm\&quot;&gt;Wells notice&lt;/a&gt; that the SEC had made a &amp;ldquo;preliminary determination&amp;rdquo; that Robinhood had violated securities law as an unregistered securities broker. The SEC made similar allegations concerning Coinbase&amp;rsquo;s activities.&amp;nbsp; The complaint is expected to be filed in the coming months which will provide more details as to the merits of the SEC&amp;rsquo;s allegations and hopefully more clarity on which tokens the SEC thinks are securities and why.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap was also served a Wells notice alleging that the decentralized exchange (DEX) it is operating is an unregistered securities broker and unregistered exchange, and the UNI token is an investment contract.&amp;nbsp; This is an important case to watch as Uniswap has already won a class action lawsuit where Judge Katherine Polk Failla &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv02780/577791/90/0.pdf?ts=1693496494\&quot;&gt;ruled &lt;/a&gt;that Uniswap, by writing the code of the smart contract, was not a &amp;ldquo;seller&amp;rdquo; of tokens and thus not a financial intermediary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap responded&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; on 5/21/24 arguing the Protocol has facilitated over $2tn in transactions and offers significant consumer benefits by eliminating intermediaries, potentially saving American investors $12bn annually if adopted in traditional equity markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amidst these regulatory actions, the recent &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409277\&quot;&gt;passage&lt;/a&gt; of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the House represents a significant legislative development in the digital assets sector. We expect FIT21 will bring stability and clarity to the digital assets ecosystem since it provides participants with a clear process to determine which digital asset transactions are subject to the SEC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction and the CFTC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction. Specifically, the CFTC will have jurisdiction over a digital asset as a commodity if the blockchain is functional and decentralized. The bill defines decentralization as: &amp;ldquo;if, among other requirements, no person has unilateral authority to control the blockchain or its usage, and no issuer or affiliated person &lt;b&gt;has control of 20 percent or more of the digital asset or the voting power of the digital asset.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the robust support from 71 Democrats, exceeding expectations, the bill faces considerable hurdles in the Senate. The lack of a Senate companion bill, a tight congressional schedule, and substantial opposition from key figures like Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, make its enactment this year unlikely. Although FIT21 is unlikely to be addressed in the Senate this year, it could lay the groundwork for future legislative efforts post-election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-17T17:20:35+01:00&quot;]}],&quot;relatedResources&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/bitcoin-ai-housing&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know | Figure Markets on Markets&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing - The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Mike Abbate, Chief Investment Officer, and Jesse Yuan, Senior Research Analyst&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Bitcoin selling pressure overstated\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Over the last two weeks, the price of bitcoin, along with the tech heavy NASDAQ composite, declined after Federal Reserve officials &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-inflation-prices-interest-rates-cuts-4384e6b128915458aba2d178bf31ee1b\&quot;&gt;signaled&lt;/a&gt; to the market that they anticipate only one interest-rate cut for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;As the interest in AI remains at fever pitch, we call attention to the less advertised dilemma for the AI industry; where to plug in the computers to train the AI models.&amp;nbsp; The AI industry has much to learn from the bitcoin mining industry in this respect and we see an eventual alignment of the two technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Housing prices hit all-time highs&lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The housing market is experiencing unprecedented price increases&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; due to a severe supply-demand imbalance which we expect to continue. Scarcity is a common thread that runs between the US housing market and the crypto market worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin selling pressure overstated&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it is difficult to point to any single catalyst for the selling pressure for bitcoin, we highlight two. The first being the obvious jawboning from Fed officials after their June meeting to walk back rate cuts later this year. Given the Feds historical performance, we do not give much credence to any of their projections.&amp;nbsp; Below is the chart from three years ago, with their prediction for rates in 2024.&amp;nbsp; As Lloyd Christmas once said, &amp;ldquo;I was way off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of June 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955171-fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of December 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955290-june_fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, after years of shifting deadlines, Mt. Gox, a former bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20240624_announcement_en.pdf\&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on June 24, 2024, that it would begin repayments to creditors starting in July, 2024. Bitcoin prices immediately dropped due to anticipated selling pressure following the repayments. Although it is unclear how much Mt. Gox will distribute to customers, Mt. Gox &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1JbezDVd9VsK9o1Ga9UqLydeuEvhKLAPs6\&quot;&gt;transferred&lt;/a&gt; around 142,000 bitcoin (or ~$8.8bn&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) to an unknown wallet last week, possibly as part of the plan to repay creditors. We expect many of the creditors will likely monetize their repayments since their bitcoin was acquired at a relatively low cost basis (bitcoin was priced ~$300&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; at the end of 2014). We believe selling pressure may be overstated though - assuming all of the transferred $8.8bn bitcoin is monetized, it only represents &amp;lt;1% of total monthly trading volumes. Some rough math based on trading statistics&amp;nbsp; from May:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Bitcoin May Trading Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Instrument&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;5/24 Trading Volumes&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC perps &amp;amp; futures&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1.53tn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC options&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$50.2bn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC spot&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$41bn&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC ETF&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$250mm&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1.62tn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Conclusion: even if all $8.8bn of bitcoin is sold, the selling pressure is a drop in a bucket given the global liquidity of bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going beyond disproving bearish technicals, it is worth highlighting the bullish ones.&amp;nbsp; Historically, supply and demand mechanics are favorable following halving events, which we just experienced in April. Bitcoin prices experienced significant run ups of approximately 10x, 2x, and 7x in each of the last three halvings&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, VanEck&amp;rsquo;s filing on June 27, 2024 to sell shares in a SOL ETF resulted in an immediate surge in the price of SOL, rising from $136 to a peak of $149. However, we are skeptical of approval under the current administration due to the SEC&#39;s stance that SOL is a security in its &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf\&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Binance last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do AI models and Bitcoin miners have in common? More than most people realize. Both rely heavily on data centers, which require two basic commodities: computer chips and electricity. Globally, the number of data centers has surged to over 7,000, up from 3,600 in 2015&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. This trend has caused expectations of power demand in the US to grow by 40% over the next two decades, compared to just 9% growth over the past 20 years&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, data centers are located near low-cost, renewable energy sources.&amp;nbsp; However, the cheapest electricity is typically located in remote areas, making it less than ideal for more traditional data centers due to latency concerns. Additionally, the lowest-cost, baseload sources of energy cannot not be easily turned on or off which does not deal well with fluctuating demand.&amp;nbsp; Finally, renewable energy tends to be intermittent; the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin miners have had to deal with these issues and have done so successfully by employing demand response programs: mining when energy demand is low and shutting down when demand is high. The added benefit is this load balancing uses otherwise wasted energy and helps stabilize energy grids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AI providers are facing the same difficulties and finding great value in partnering with bitcoin miners to leverage their infrastructure and expertise. Many pure-play Bitcoin miners are expanding into or partnering with high-power compute service providers. For example, Core Scientific &lt;a href=\&quot;https://investors.corescientific.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/78/core-scientific-announces-new-contract-with-coreweave-for-delivery-of-approximately-70-mw-of-additional-infrastructure-to-host-high-performance-computing-operations\&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a 12-year, $3.5bn contract to procure over 270 MW of power dedicated to AI training with CoreWeave. Hut 8 &lt;a href=\&quot;https://hut8.com/2024/06/24/hut-8-announces-150-million-strategic-investment-from-coatue-to-partner-in-building-next-generation-ai-infrastructure-platform/\&quot;&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; a $150mm investment from Coatue to develop next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this trend will continue, with renewable data centers and baseload generators paired with AI training and Bitcoin mining operations, optimizing energy use by training or mining when power prices are low and supplying power to the grid when prices are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Housing prices hit all time high&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p classname=\&quot;text-center py-4\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&quot;Buy land, they are not making any more of it\&quot; - Mark Twain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Realtors &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-edged-lower-by-0-7-in-may-as-median-sales-price-reached-record-high-of-419300\&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in May that median housing prices reached its all-time highs in the face of the highest rates in 25 years. How could this be? The answer is simple: supply and demand.&amp;nbsp; In the US, there is a cumulative housing gap of ~6.8mm homes and homeowner mobility is at all-time lows due to relatively low-rates on existing mortgages coupled with concurrent rise in aforementioned financing costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: Housing Supply and Demand Mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955923-housing_mismatch.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: Low Homeowner Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955952-market-commentary.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are constantly looking for the common themes that tie real assets to digitally native assets on decentralized blockchains: scarcity is one of our favorites. We believe the same type of investor that invests in bitcoin as a store of value would also invest in US real estate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-02T22:40:14+01:00&quot;]}]}],[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;political-shifts-ftx-cftc-settlement-and-blocks-asic-breakthrough&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Political Shifts, FTX &amp; CFTC Settlement, and Block&#39;s ASIC Breakthrough.

The agreement supplies Core Scientific with ~15 EH/s of hashrate, representing ~2.5%&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the total Bitcoin Network (&amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo;) hashrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Political Tailwinds&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since our last missive, we believe several political developments have contributed to a ~8%&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; rally in BTC price.&amp;nbsp; First and most important is the US Presidential election.&amp;nbsp; A poor performance by President Biden in the first Presidential debate, followed by a failed assassination attempt on former President Trump, has led to a surge of Trump support. Trump&amp;rsquo;s polling average is at 42.3% compared to Biden&amp;rsquo;s 40.8%&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; while Polymarket has Trump&amp;rsquo;s chance of winning at 72% against Biden&amp;rsquo;s 19%&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Endorsements from notable figures such as Elon Musk and Bill Ackman further support the &amp;ldquo;Trump Trade&amp;rdquo; in the markets, which consists of three pillars based on Trump&#39;s past term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;More protectionist policies, which are decisively inflationary&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;Increased spending / larger deficits and lower rates, i.e., fiat money debasement&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;A more lenient / crypto-friendly regulatory environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confirming the &amp;ldquo;Trump Trade&amp;rdquo; as crypto-friendly was the announcement of JD Vance as the Vice Presidential candidate.&amp;nbsp; Vance has disclosed more than $100,000 in Bitcoin holdings&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, is circulating a draft Senate legislation that is reportedly more crypto-friendly than the House&amp;rsquo;s FIT21&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and has opposed anti-crypto legislation in the past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s recent reversal of what is commonly known as the Chevron deference bodes well for the crypto industry. The Chevron deference&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; refers to case law from 1984, where the court ruled in a case involving Chevron (yes, the oil company) that government entities tasked with regulating an industry have broad power to interpret any ambiguity in the actual statues as opposed to having the courts clarify that ambiguity. Obviously the most ambiguous industry with respect to regulation has clearly been crypto and the SEC has been relying on this precedent to carry out much of its &amp;ldquo;regulation by enforcement&amp;rdquo; campaign.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the long awaited ETH ETF launched on July 23rd. We have written about implications in past commentary which you can find &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/markets-on-markets-v1/\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Rally on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX CFTC Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realize how ubiquitous FTX exposure was in the industry and how many of our readers were adversely affected.&amp;nbsp; So we continue to report on the bankruptcy to better inform everyone no matter what their position is with respect to the case.&amp;nbsp; We know that wading through a court docket with 20,000+ filings can be overwhelming, do not worry, here are our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 7/12/2024, FTX and CFTC reached a settlement, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing FTX bankruptcy proceedings. The CFTC was the largest and single most significant creditor of&amp;nbsp; FTX with ~$52bn of claims for restitution, disgorgement and civil monetary penalties&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. The estate&amp;rsquo;s recovery projections in its proposed Chapter 11 Plan (&amp;ldquo;Plan&amp;rdquo;) is predicated on a CFTC settlement with terms similar to those reached with the IRS. Without the settlement, customer recoveries would have been significantly impacted and limited to par plus accrued interest at the claim value at time of petition&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (you can check out our memo &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/markets-on-markets-v1/\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; describing how disingenuous a &amp;ldquo;par&amp;rdquo; recovery is vs. the rally in crypto). Under the settlement, the CFTC agreed to reduce its disgorgement claim to $4bn&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and, more importantly, provide any recoveries on this claim to US Customer Entitlement Claims, Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims, Digital Asset Loan Claims, and Digital Markets Customer Entitlement Claims for supplemental payments (additional customer recoveries) via a Supplemental Remission Fund on a prorata basis. The CFTC settlement along with recent IRS settlement&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; resolve the largest hurdles in achieving estimated customer recoveries per the Plan and is a major win for creditors. The settlement becomes effective only upon the confirmation of the Estate&amp;rsquo;s proposed Chapter 11 Plan.&amp;nbsp; Important dates to note are &lt;b&gt;8/16/2024 &lt;/b&gt;(the voting deadline), &lt;b&gt;10/7/2024&lt;/b&gt; (deadline for the court to approve the Plan), and &lt;b&gt;10/30/2024&lt;/b&gt; (assumed effective date).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A new ASIC provider to the mining industry is just a chip off the Block&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Block, Inc., the payments company leaning into Bitcoin, produced and sold its first ASIC&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; machine to customer Core Scientific.&amp;nbsp; The agreement supplies Core Scientific with ~15 EH/s of hashrate, representing ~2.5%&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of the total Bitcoin Network (&amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo;) hashrate. The new machines will use 3nm chips, leapfrogging the competition that currently uses 5nm chips&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, thanks to a partnership with a &amp;ldquo;leading foundry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This development is significant not only because it introduces a new entrant into the ASIC market, adding to the competition and decentralization of the Network, but also because it is an American company leading the design.&amp;nbsp; Currently, a very small number of Chinese companies (e.g, Bitmain, Whatsminer, etc.) have near or total control over the distribution of all hash power, a situation that would not sit well under a Trump administration (see above on tariffs).&amp;nbsp; Overconcentration of hash power from a few manufacturers is also problematic for a network that is supposed to be decentralized. Risks could include ASICs potentially containing hidden malware and hardware bugs, among others. Additionally, without a competitive ASIC market, these few firms become price makers and wield undue influence on who has access to hash power. Miner fleets are constantly being upgraded to keep up with mining difficulty (hash rate is up 6x since 2021&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;). Although we do not have the specs for the new miner, we assume it is more efficient than the outstanding fleet given its 3nm chip.&amp;nbsp; More efficient miners being installed lead to higher hash rates and higher hash rates have historically had a strong correlation with price. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Bitcoin Network Hashrate vs. Bitcoin Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1722017866-figure-markets-bitcoin-network-hashrate-vs-bitcoin-price.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if only NVIDIA would make an ASIC chip for BTC mining...&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-26T19:24:33+01:00&quot;]}]}],[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything You Need to Know About Crypto Loans&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Learn how crypto currency loans work, their benefits, how to get a crypto loan, and how to borrow against your crypto.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything you need to know about Crypto Loans&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets Research Group&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;The world of crypto is constantly evolving, going far beyond just buying and selling digital assets. One exciting development is the rise of crypto loans, also known as cryptocurrency loans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a crypto loan, you can borrow a traditional currency (like USD or EUR) or a stablecoin (like USDC) by using your cryptocurrency as collateral just like you would use other assets - like a house or a car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This concept brings more flexibility and a unique opportunity to leverage existing crypto assets to secure financing. But how exactly do crypto loans work? What are the benefits and risks involved? And how do crypto loans compare to traditional loans?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned crypto user or just exploring the possibilities, this guide will help you understand everything you need to know about how crypto loans work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Want to explore the world of crypto-backed loans at your own pace? Download the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&quot;/Figure-Markets-The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Crypto-Backed-Loans.pdf\&quot;&gt;Ultimate Guide to Crypto-Backed Loans&lt;/a&gt; and read it later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What is a crypto loan?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Navigating the world of crypto lending can feel like wading through a sea of jargon and technical terms. But don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;re here to help. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the most common terms you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter, making it simple and straightforward for you to understand how crypto loans work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;Crypto lending glossary\&quot; title=\&quot;Crypto lending glossery\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642575-crypto-lending-glossary.png\&quot; width=\&quot;772\&quot; height=\&quot;1264\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve familiarized yourself with the most common crypto lending terms, let&amp;rsquo;s understand what crypto-backed loans are and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A crypto loan is a type of secured loan in which you pledge digital assets as collateral to receive a loan in fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR, BRL) or stablecoins (e.g. USDC, USDT). It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a traditional secured loan, like a mortgage or a car loan, in which the asset acts as a security for the lender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How are crypto loans different from traditional loans?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans that typically require credit checks and extensive paperwork, crypto loans offer a more streamlined and accessible lending process:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No credit checks: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans do not require credit checks. The collateral itself reduces the lender&amp;rsquo;s risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faster approval: &lt;/b&gt;The process is usually fast and straightforward, with funds often available quickly.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency: &lt;/b&gt;Some crypto loans leverage blockchain technology, offering a decentralized and transparent process that eliminates many of the inefficiencies of conventional banking systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tax benefits: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans may provide some borrowers with certain tax benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Types of crypto loans&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cryptocurrency loans: CeFi and DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Centralized finance (CeFi) loans are crypto loans offered by centralized institutions or platforms. Similar to traditional loans, they may be easier to use but require trusting a central entity with your crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642854-cefi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance (DeFi) loans are cryptocurrency loans managed by smart contracts on a blockchain network, which means no intermediaries. They offer greater transparency, accessibility and, often, lower fees, but come with higher risk and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642863-defi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing between CeFi and DeFi for crypto loans depends on your preference. CeFi offers ease of use, compliance, and customer support, but at the cost of higher fees and less control. DeFi provides greater control, transparency, and potentially lower fees, but requires technical know-how and carries higher security risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How to get a crypto loan&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to take out a crypto-backed loan, each offering unique advantages to suit different needs. You can choose centralized finance (CeFi) platforms for straightforward, secure loans, or explore decentralized finance (DeFi) options for greater control but require greater technical knowledge to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a general overview on how to take out loans on each type of platform. For more specifics, please refer to the specific platform&amp;rsquo;s instructions on their respective websites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a CeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Create an account on a CeFi platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Send collateral&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Borrow funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a DeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Set up a crypto wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2. Install and configure wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Transfer the crypto assets you plan to use as collateral to your wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Connect to DeFi lending platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Deposit collateral&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Borrow Funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking out a DeFi crypto loan generally requires more constant monitoring compared to CeFi loans due to the nature of smart contracts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, smart contracts are programmed to automatically liquidate collateral if certain conditions, such as a LTV ratio, are met. This automation ensures prompt action but also means that borrowers must vigilantly track the value of their collateral and market conditions to avoid sudden liquidation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike CeFi crypto loans, where there might be more flexibility and time to respond to margin calls, DeFi loans generally offer no such leniency, making continuous monitoring essential to manage the risk of automatic liquidation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest rates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DeFi crypto loans often come with variable interest rates, which are generally determined based on market demand and supply conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans with fixed rates, DeFi loan rates are determined by algorithms within smart contracts that adjust in real time. This variability can lead to opportunities for lower interest payments during periods of high liquidity but also carries the risk of rising rates during times of increased borrowing demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must be aware of these fluctuations and manage your loans accordingly, as the dynamic nature of DeFi interest rates can impact the overall cost and feasibility of maintaining your positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Taking it all in?

If the value of your crypto collateral drops significantly, the lender may issue a margin call and require you to deposit additional collateral to maintain the agreed LTV ratio. If you fail to do so, they might liquidate your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all lenders issue margin calls, and in some cases, collateral may be automatically liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes down in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin falls to $20,000, the value of your collateral decreases to $20,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio increases to 50%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has dropped. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643144-crypto-collateral-value-decrease.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An increase in the LTV ratio indicates higher risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth less relative to the loan amount. If the LTV ratio exceeds a certain threshold, such as 70-80%, the lender may issue a margin call, requiring you to add more collateral or repay part of the loan. Failure to meet the margin call could result in the lender liquidating your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes up in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin rises to $50,000, the value of your collateral increases to $50,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio decreases to 20%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has increased. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643110-crypto-collateral-value-increase.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A decrease in the LTV ratio indicates lower risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth more relative to the loan amount. This increased security reduces the likelihood of a margin call or the need for additional collateral. Additionally, you may be eligible to borrow more funds against the increased value of your Bitcoin collateral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What are the U.S. federal tax implications of taking out a crypto-backed loan?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When considering taking out a crypto-backed loan in the United States, it&#39;s important to understand the potential tax implications. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of key considerations. This is not tax, legal, or investment advice, and applicable tax rules and guidance are subject to change, please consult with tax professional:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Receiving the loan&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, receiving proceeds from a loan, including a crypto-backed loan, is not considered a taxable event. You do not incur a tax liability on the loan amount received when you open the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest payments&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interest payments on a crypto-backed loan may or may not be deductible. If the loan is used for investment purposes, the interest may qualify as a deductible expense. However, if the loan is used for personal purposes, the interest is typically not deductible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Collateral liquidation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;If your collateral is liquidated to repay the loan, this triggers a taxable event. You may owe capital gains tax if the value of the cryptocurrency has increased since your purchase date. The gain is generally calculated based on the difference between the sale price of an asset and its cost basis (generally, the original purchase price plus acquisition costs).&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;The tax rate depends on how long you held the asset before it was liquidated. If held for more than a year, the gain may&amp;nbsp; qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower than short-term rates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan repayment&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repaying the principal amount of the loan using cash (i.e., fiat) is generally not a taxable event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Reporting requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any gains from the liquidation of collateral must be reported on your tax return.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you need cash to cover unexpected expenses, for an investment opportunity, or to diversify your portfolio, a crypto-backed loan can provide the financial flexibility you need while keeping your crypto holdings intact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto-backed loans often come with lower interest rates compared to traditional unsecured loans, and they typically don&amp;rsquo;t require credit checks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of getting a crypto-backed loan? &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/borrow/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=cta-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ultimate-guide\&quot;&gt;Apply today&lt;/a&gt; at Figure Markets!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything you need to know about crypto loans&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1501],&quot;width&quot;:[0,4800]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-10T21:47:05+01:00&quot;]}]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-02T22:40:14+01:00&quot;],&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/bitcoin-ai-housing&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know | Figure Markets on Markets&quot;]}],&quot;multipleBlockContent&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;disclaimerGroup&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets on Markets Vol 2&quot;],&quot;disclaimerType&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets on Markets v2 sources&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;1.

Scarcity is a common thread that runs between the US housing market and the crypto market worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin selling pressure overstated&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it is difficult to point to any single catalyst for the selling pressure for bitcoin, we highlight two. The first being the obvious jawboning from Fed officials after their June meeting to walk back rate cuts later this year. Given the Feds historical performance, we do not give much credence to any of their projections.&amp;nbsp; Below is the chart from three years ago, with their prediction for rates in 2024.&amp;nbsp; As Lloyd Christmas once said, &amp;ldquo;I was way off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of June 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955171-fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of December 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955290-june_fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, after years of shifting deadlines, Mt. Gox, a former bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20240624_announcement_en.pdf\&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on June 24, 2024, that it would begin repayments to creditors starting in July, 2024. Bitcoin prices immediately dropped due to anticipated selling pressure following the repayments. Although it is unclear how much Mt. Gox will distribute to customers, Mt. Gox &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1JbezDVd9VsK9o1Ga9UqLydeuEvhKLAPs6\&quot;&gt;transferred&lt;/a&gt; around 142,000 bitcoin (or ~$8.8bn&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) to an unknown wallet last week, possibly as part of the plan to repay creditors. We expect many of the creditors will likely monetize their repayments since their bitcoin was acquired at a relatively low cost basis (bitcoin was priced ~$300&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; at the end of 2014). We believe selling pressure may be overstated though - assuming all of the transferred $8.8bn bitcoin is monetized, it only represents &amp;lt;1% of total monthly trading volumes. Some rough math based on trading statistics&amp;nbsp; from May:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Bitcoin May Trading Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Instrument&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;5/24 Trading Volumes&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC perps &amp;amp; futures&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1.53tn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC options&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$50.2bn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC spot&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$41bn&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC ETF&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$250mm&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1.62tn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Conclusion: even if all $8.8bn of bitcoin is sold, the selling pressure is a drop in a bucket given the global liquidity of bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going beyond disproving bearish technicals, it is worth highlighting the bullish ones.&amp;nbsp; Historically, supply and demand mechanics are favorable following halving events, which we just experienced in April. Bitcoin prices experienced significant run ups of approximately 10x, 2x, and 7x in each of the last three halvings&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, VanEck&amp;rsquo;s filing on June 27, 2024 to sell shares in a SOL ETF resulted in an immediate surge in the price of SOL, rising from $136 to a peak of $149. However, we are skeptical of approval under the current administration due to the SEC&#39;s stance that SOL is a security in its &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf\&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Binance last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do AI models and Bitcoin miners have in common? More than most people realize. Both rely heavily on data centers, which require two basic commodities: computer chips and electricity. Globally, the number of data centers has surged to over 7,000, up from 3,600 in 2015&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. This trend has caused expectations of power demand in the US to grow by 40% over the next two decades, compared to just 9% growth over the past 20 years&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, data centers are located near low-cost, renewable energy sources.&amp;nbsp; However, the cheapest electricity is typically located in remote areas, making it less than ideal for more traditional data centers due to latency concerns. Additionally, the lowest-cost, baseload sources of energy cannot not be easily turned on or off which does not deal well with fluctuating demand.&amp;nbsp; Finally, renewable energy tends to be intermittent; the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin miners have had to deal with these issues and have done so successfully by employing demand response programs: mining when energy demand is low and shutting down when demand is high. The added benefit is this load balancing uses otherwise wasted energy and helps stabilize energy grids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AI providers are facing the same difficulties and finding great value in partnering with bitcoin miners to leverage their infrastructure and expertise. Many pure-play Bitcoin miners are expanding into or partnering with high-power compute service providers. For example, Core Scientific &lt;a href=\&quot;https://investors.corescientific.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/78/core-scientific-announces-new-contract-with-coreweave-for-delivery-of-approximately-70-mw-of-additional-infrastructure-to-host-high-performance-computing-operations\&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a 12-year, $3.5bn contract to procure over 270 MW of power dedicated to AI training with CoreWeave. Hut 8 &lt;a href=\&quot;https://hut8.com/2024/06/24/hut-8-announces-150-million-strategic-investment-from-coatue-to-partner-in-building-next-generation-ai-infrastructure-platform/\&quot;&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; a $150mm investment from Coatue to develop next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this trend will continue, with renewable data centers and baseload generators paired with AI training and Bitcoin mining operations, optimizing energy use by training or mining when power prices are low and supplying power to the grid when prices are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Housing prices hit all time high&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p classname=\&quot;text-center py-4\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&quot;Buy land, they are not making any more of it\&quot; - Mark Twain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Realtors &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-edged-lower-by-0-7-in-may-as-median-sales-price-reached-record-high-of-419300\&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in May that median housing prices reached its all-time highs in the face of the highest rates in 25 years. How could this be? The answer is simple: supply and demand.&amp;nbsp; In the US, there is a cumulative housing gap of ~6.8mm homes and homeowner mobility is at all-time lows due to relatively low-rates on existing mortgages coupled with concurrent rise in aforementioned financing costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: Housing Supply and Demand Mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955923-housing_mismatch.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: Low Homeowner Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955952-market-commentary.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are constantly looking for the common themes that tie real assets to digitally native assets on decentralized blockchains: scarcity is one of our favorites. We believe the same type of investor that invests in bitcoin as a store of value would also invest in US real estate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-02T22:40:14+01:00&quot;]}],&quot;relatedResources&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;political-shifts-ftx-cftc-settlement-and-blocks-asic-breakthrough&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Political Shifts, FTX &amp; CFTC Settlement, and Block&#39;s ASIC Breakthrough.

The agreement supplies Core Scientific with ~15 EH/s of hashrate, representing ~2.5%&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the total Bitcoin Network (&amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo;) hashrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Political Tailwinds&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since our last missive, we believe several political developments have contributed to a ~8%&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; rally in BTC price.&amp;nbsp; First and most important is the US Presidential election.&amp;nbsp; A poor performance by President Biden in the first Presidential debate, followed by a failed assassination attempt on former President Trump, has led to a surge of Trump support. Trump&amp;rsquo;s polling average is at 42.3% compared to Biden&amp;rsquo;s 40.8%&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; while Polymarket has Trump&amp;rsquo;s chance of winning at 72% against Biden&amp;rsquo;s 19%&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. Endorsements from notable figures such as Elon Musk and Bill Ackman further support the &amp;ldquo;Trump Trade&amp;rdquo; in the markets, which consists of three pillars based on Trump&#39;s past term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;More protectionist policies, which are decisively inflationary&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;Increased spending / larger deficits and lower rates, i.e., fiat money debasement&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot; aria-level=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;A more lenient / crypto-friendly regulatory environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confirming the &amp;ldquo;Trump Trade&amp;rdquo; as crypto-friendly was the announcement of JD Vance as the Vice Presidential candidate.&amp;nbsp; Vance has disclosed more than $100,000 in Bitcoin holdings&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, is circulating a draft Senate legislation that is reportedly more crypto-friendly than the House&amp;rsquo;s FIT21&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and has opposed anti-crypto legislation in the past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s recent reversal of what is commonly known as the Chevron deference bodes well for the crypto industry. The Chevron deference&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; refers to case law from 1984, where the court ruled in a case involving Chevron (yes, the oil company) that government entities tasked with regulating an industry have broad power to interpret any ambiguity in the actual statues as opposed to having the courts clarify that ambiguity. Obviously the most ambiguous industry with respect to regulation has clearly been crypto and the SEC has been relying on this precedent to carry out much of its &amp;ldquo;regulation by enforcement&amp;rdquo; campaign.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the long awaited ETH ETF launched on July 23rd. We have written about implications in past commentary which you can find &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/markets-on-markets-v1/\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Rally on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX CFTC Settlement&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realize how ubiquitous FTX exposure was in the industry and how many of our readers were adversely affected.&amp;nbsp; So we continue to report on the bankruptcy to better inform everyone no matter what their position is with respect to the case.&amp;nbsp; We know that wading through a court docket with 20,000+ filings can be overwhelming, do not worry, here are our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 7/12/2024, FTX and CFTC reached a settlement, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing FTX bankruptcy proceedings. The CFTC was the largest and single most significant creditor of&amp;nbsp; FTX with ~$52bn of claims for restitution, disgorgement and civil monetary penalties&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. The estate&amp;rsquo;s recovery projections in its proposed Chapter 11 Plan (&amp;ldquo;Plan&amp;rdquo;) is predicated on a CFTC settlement with terms similar to those reached with the IRS. Without the settlement, customer recoveries would have been significantly impacted and limited to par plus accrued interest at the claim value at time of petition&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (you can check out our memo &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/resources/insights/markets-on-markets-v1/\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; describing how disingenuous a &amp;ldquo;par&amp;rdquo; recovery is vs. the rally in crypto). Under the settlement, the CFTC agreed to reduce its disgorgement claim to $4bn&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; and, more importantly, provide any recoveries on this claim to US Customer Entitlement Claims, Dotcom Customer Entitlement Claims, Digital Asset Loan Claims, and Digital Markets Customer Entitlement Claims for supplemental payments (additional customer recoveries) via a Supplemental Remission Fund on a prorata basis. The CFTC settlement along with recent IRS settlement&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; resolve the largest hurdles in achieving estimated customer recoveries per the Plan and is a major win for creditors. The settlement becomes effective only upon the confirmation of the Estate&amp;rsquo;s proposed Chapter 11 Plan.&amp;nbsp; Important dates to note are &lt;b&gt;8/16/2024 &lt;/b&gt;(the voting deadline), &lt;b&gt;10/7/2024&lt;/b&gt; (deadline for the court to approve the Plan), and &lt;b&gt;10/30/2024&lt;/b&gt; (assumed effective date).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;A new ASIC provider to the mining industry is just a chip off the Block&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Block, Inc., the payments company leaning into Bitcoin, produced and sold its first ASIC&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; machine to customer Core Scientific.&amp;nbsp; The agreement supplies Core Scientific with ~15 EH/s of hashrate, representing ~2.5%&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of the total Bitcoin Network (&amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo;) hashrate. The new machines will use 3nm chips, leapfrogging the competition that currently uses 5nm chips&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, thanks to a partnership with a &amp;ldquo;leading foundry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This development is significant not only because it introduces a new entrant into the ASIC market, adding to the competition and decentralization of the Network, but also because it is an American company leading the design.&amp;nbsp; Currently, a very small number of Chinese companies (e.g, Bitmain, Whatsminer, etc.) have near or total control over the distribution of all hash power, a situation that would not sit well under a Trump administration (see above on tariffs).&amp;nbsp; Overconcentration of hash power from a few manufacturers is also problematic for a network that is supposed to be decentralized. Risks could include ASICs potentially containing hidden malware and hardware bugs, among others. Additionally, without a competitive ASIC market, these few firms become price makers and wield undue influence on who has access to hash power. Miner fleets are constantly being upgraded to keep up with mining difficulty (hash rate is up 6x since 2021&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;). Although we do not have the specs for the new miner, we assume it is more efficient than the outstanding fleet given its 3nm chip.&amp;nbsp; More efficient miners being installed lead to higher hash rates and higher hash rates have historically had a strong correlation with price. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Bitcoin Network Hashrate vs. Bitcoin Price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1722017866-figure-markets-bitcoin-network-hashrate-vs-bitcoin-price.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, if only NVIDIA would make an ASIC chip for BTC mining...&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-26T19:24:33+01:00&quot;]}]}],[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/markets-on-markets-v1&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets on Markets: BTC &amp; ETH Near All-Time Highs, FTX Update, New US Crypto Bill (FIT21)&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Dive into market analysis of Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum price movements, the latest on FTX, and the potential impact of the new FIT21 Act on crypto regulations.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets on Markets - volume 1&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;May 2024 Recap&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Mike Abbate, Chief Investment Officer, and Jesse Yuan, Senior Research Analyst&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Figure Markets on the Markets, a newsletter where we provide commentary and insights on the ever-evolving world of traditional and decentralized financial markets.

Currently, these ETFs hold over $59bn or 835k BTC, representing nearly 8% of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s active supply&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This follows the April halving, which reduced BTC&amp;rsquo;s yearly supply from 328,500 to 164,250.&amp;nbsp; The wrinkle worth noting when comparing BTC and ETH ETFs revolves around staking. Certain issuers such as Fidelity and Franklin Templeton have removed staking from the ETH ETFs due to regulatory pressures. &lt;b&gt;Spot ETH ETFs that omit staking will have an increased opportunity cost of holding ETH through an ETF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhibit 1: Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Ticker&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Total Flows&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;June 3 AUM&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Seed Capital&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;IBIT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,669.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20,146.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$10.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;FBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$8,977.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$11,418.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BITB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,984.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,555.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$200.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ARKB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,490&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$3,270.6&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.4&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCO&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$318.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$504.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$5.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BRRR&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$511.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$592.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;EZBC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$362.0&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$424.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.6&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;HODL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$524.1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$691.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$72.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCW&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$70.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$89.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;GBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;-$17,875.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$19,712.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$28,581.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total Net Flow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$14,032.6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$59,406.8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$28,894.7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we at the end of the short term bull market or somewhere in the middle? The MVRV ratio would suggest the latter.&amp;nbsp; Many traders look at what is called the MVRV ratio as an indication of bull and bear markets.&amp;nbsp; MVRV measures the current market cap of a token over the last traded price of a token. Historically, buy signals exist when the ratio approaches one (not many people have trading gains to monetize), and sell signals appear when the ratio trends above three (an indication most people are buying the local highs). At the end of May 2024, MVRV for ETH was 2.12&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, pretty much smack in the middle of the historical buy / sell range.&amp;nbsp; We believe that MVRV will continue to rise as spot ETFs purchases move tokens &amp;ldquo;off exchange&amp;rdquo; while token supply has generally been deflationary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: BTC and ETH MVRV&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718642911-btc_and_eth_mvrv.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Circulating ETH Supply&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718640654-eth_supply.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX Claims&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FTX estate released its much anticipated Chapter 11 Plan with an expected effective date of 10/31/24. FTX holds nearly $9.9bn in cash and $1.4bn in digital assets (digital assets are marked at petition prices) as of 4/30/24&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. During the month, FTX received payments for their Anthropic sale of $884mm&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. An additional $2.7bn in cash is expected to be received from the monetization of assets before the end of October, bringing the total estimated cash to ~$12.6bn. After the effective date, another $2.5bn to $4.3bn of assets are expected to be monetized for cash. In total, the estate expects to have &lt;b&gt;$15.1bn to $16.9bn&lt;/b&gt; of net distributed assets.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The estate currently estimates $11.2bn of allowable claims with estimated customer recoveries, after netting out priority claims, to be between 119% and 143% (see Exhibit 4) of their Petition Date claim values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: FTX Recoveries&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Estimated Percent Recovery&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 5A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Customer&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;129% - 143%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 7A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Convenience Class&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;119%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite these seemingly strong results, it is important to note that the claim values are calculated as of petition date prices (see Exhibit 5). Therefore, if a customer had one bitcoin on the platform at filing, his / her claim would only be for $16,871 dollars not for the $70,000 dollars where bitcoin is trading today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: FTX Petition Date Prices&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Asset&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Petition Price&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,871.63&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETH&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,258.84&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16.2471144&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;USDT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.9975910&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a BTC denominated claim would need a 415% recovery for a creditor to receive a comparable amount of value back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;A creditor that had SOL on the platform would need a 1,000% recovery to break even.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers should expect to wait until at least December of 2024 or early 2025 before they receive their claim distributions, subject to completion of KYC and necessary distribution information materials. Claims volumes and prices have continued to increase as customer demand for immediate liquidity on their claims rises and buyers feel more confidence in recoveries as the estate continues to monetize its assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory and Policy Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SEC remains hawkish on the space and continues to regulate through enforcement. In May 2024, Robinhood received a &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000178387924000138/hood-20240504.htm\&quot;&gt;Wells notice&lt;/a&gt; that the SEC had made a &amp;ldquo;preliminary determination&amp;rdquo; that Robinhood had violated securities law as an unregistered securities broker. The SEC made similar allegations concerning Coinbase&amp;rsquo;s activities.&amp;nbsp; The complaint is expected to be filed in the coming months which will provide more details as to the merits of the SEC&amp;rsquo;s allegations and hopefully more clarity on which tokens the SEC thinks are securities and why.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap was also served a Wells notice alleging that the decentralized exchange (DEX) it is operating is an unregistered securities broker and unregistered exchange, and the UNI token is an investment contract.&amp;nbsp; This is an important case to watch as Uniswap has already won a class action lawsuit where Judge Katherine Polk Failla &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv02780/577791/90/0.pdf?ts=1693496494\&quot;&gt;ruled &lt;/a&gt;that Uniswap, by writing the code of the smart contract, was not a &amp;ldquo;seller&amp;rdquo; of tokens and thus not a financial intermediary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap responded&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; on 5/21/24 arguing the Protocol has facilitated over $2tn in transactions and offers significant consumer benefits by eliminating intermediaries, potentially saving American investors $12bn annually if adopted in traditional equity markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amidst these regulatory actions, the recent &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409277\&quot;&gt;passage&lt;/a&gt; of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the House represents a significant legislative development in the digital assets sector. We expect FIT21 will bring stability and clarity to the digital assets ecosystem since it provides participants with a clear process to determine which digital asset transactions are subject to the SEC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction and the CFTC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction. Specifically, the CFTC will have jurisdiction over a digital asset as a commodity if the blockchain is functional and decentralized. The bill defines decentralization as: &amp;ldquo;if, among other requirements, no person has unilateral authority to control the blockchain or its usage, and no issuer or affiliated person &lt;b&gt;has control of 20 percent or more of the digital asset or the voting power of the digital asset.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the robust support from 71 Democrats, exceeding expectations, the bill faces considerable hurdles in the Senate. The lack of a Senate companion bill, a tight congressional schedule, and substantial opposition from key figures like Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, make its enactment this year unlikely. Although FIT21 is unlikely to be addressed in the Senate this year, it could lay the groundwork for future legislative efforts post-election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-17T17:20:35+01:00&quot;]}]}],[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything You Need to Know About Crypto Loans&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Learn how crypto currency loans work, their benefits, how to get a crypto loan, and how to borrow against your crypto.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything you need to know about Crypto Loans&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets Research Group&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;The world of crypto is constantly evolving, going far beyond just buying and selling digital assets. One exciting development is the rise of crypto loans, also known as cryptocurrency loans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a crypto loan, you can borrow a traditional currency (like USD or EUR) or a stablecoin (like USDC) by using your cryptocurrency as collateral just like you would use other assets - like a house or a car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This concept brings more flexibility and a unique opportunity to leverage existing crypto assets to secure financing.

It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a traditional secured loan, like a mortgage or a car loan, in which the asset acts as a security for the lender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How are crypto loans different from traditional loans?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans that typically require credit checks and extensive paperwork, crypto loans offer a more streamlined and accessible lending process:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No credit checks: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans do not require credit checks. The collateral itself reduces the lender&amp;rsquo;s risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faster approval: &lt;/b&gt;The process is usually fast and straightforward, with funds often available quickly.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency: &lt;/b&gt;Some crypto loans leverage blockchain technology, offering a decentralized and transparent process that eliminates many of the inefficiencies of conventional banking systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tax benefits: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans may provide some borrowers with certain tax benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Types of crypto loans&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cryptocurrency loans: CeFi and DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Centralized finance (CeFi) loans are crypto loans offered by centralized institutions or platforms. Similar to traditional loans, they may be easier to use but require trusting a central entity with your crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642854-cefi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance (DeFi) loans are cryptocurrency loans managed by smart contracts on a blockchain network, which means no intermediaries. They offer greater transparency, accessibility and, often, lower fees, but come with higher risk and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642863-defi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing between CeFi and DeFi for crypto loans depends on your preference. CeFi offers ease of use, compliance, and customer support, but at the cost of higher fees and less control. DeFi provides greater control, transparency, and potentially lower fees, but requires technical know-how and carries higher security risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How to get a crypto loan&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to take out a crypto-backed loan, each offering unique advantages to suit different needs. You can choose centralized finance (CeFi) platforms for straightforward, secure loans, or explore decentralized finance (DeFi) options for greater control but require greater technical knowledge to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a general overview on how to take out loans on each type of platform. For more specifics, please refer to the specific platform&amp;rsquo;s instructions on their respective websites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a CeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Create an account on a CeFi platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Send collateral&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Borrow funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a DeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Set up a crypto wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2. Install and configure wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Transfer the crypto assets you plan to use as collateral to your wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Connect to DeFi lending platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Deposit collateral&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Borrow Funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking out a DeFi crypto loan generally requires more constant monitoring compared to CeFi loans due to the nature of smart contracts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, smart contracts are programmed to automatically liquidate collateral if certain conditions, such as a LTV ratio, are met. This automation ensures prompt action but also means that borrowers must vigilantly track the value of their collateral and market conditions to avoid sudden liquidation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike CeFi crypto loans, where there might be more flexibility and time to respond to margin calls, DeFi loans generally offer no such leniency, making continuous monitoring essential to manage the risk of automatic liquidation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest rates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DeFi crypto loans often come with variable interest rates, which are generally determined based on market demand and supply conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans with fixed rates, DeFi loan rates are determined by algorithms within smart contracts that adjust in real time. This variability can lead to opportunities for lower interest payments during periods of high liquidity but also carries the risk of rising rates during times of increased borrowing demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must be aware of these fluctuations and manage your loans accordingly, as the dynamic nature of DeFi interest rates can impact the overall cost and feasibility of maintaining your positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Taking it all in? Download the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\&quot;/Figure-Markets-The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Crypto-Backed-Loans.pdf\&quot;&gt;Ultimate Guide to Crypto-Backed Loans&lt;/a&gt; and have it at your fingertips for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Crypto loans and margin calls&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One critical aspect of crypto loans is the risk of margin calls. If the value of your crypto collateral drops significantly, the lender may issue a margin call and require you to deposit additional collateral to maintain the agreed LTV ratio. If you fail to do so, they might liquidate your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all lenders issue margin calls, and in some cases, collateral may be automatically liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes down in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin falls to $20,000, the value of your collateral decreases to $20,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio increases to 50%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has dropped. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643144-crypto-collateral-value-decrease.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An increase in the LTV ratio indicates higher risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth less relative to the loan amount. If the LTV ratio exceeds a certain threshold, such as 70-80%, the lender may issue a margin call, requiring you to add more collateral or repay part of the loan. Failure to meet the margin call could result in the lender liquidating your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes up in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin rises to $50,000, the value of your collateral increases to $50,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio decreases to 20%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has increased. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643110-crypto-collateral-value-increase.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A decrease in the LTV ratio indicates lower risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth more relative to the loan amount. This increased security reduces the likelihood of a margin call or the need for additional collateral. Additionally, you may be eligible to borrow more funds against the increased value of your Bitcoin collateral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What are the U.S. federal tax implications of taking out a crypto-backed loan?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When considering taking out a crypto-backed loan in the United States, it&#39;s important to understand the potential tax implications. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of key considerations. This is not tax, legal, or investment advice, and applicable tax rules and guidance are subject to change, please consult with tax professional:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Receiving the loan&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, receiving proceeds from a loan, including a crypto-backed loan, is not considered a taxable event. You do not incur a tax liability on the loan amount received when you open the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest payments&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interest payments on a crypto-backed loan may or may not be deductible. If the loan is used for investment purposes, the interest may qualify as a deductible expense. However, if the loan is used for personal purposes, the interest is typically not deductible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Collateral liquidation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;If your collateral is liquidated to repay the loan, this triggers a taxable event. You may owe capital gains tax if the value of the cryptocurrency has increased since your purchase date. The gain is generally calculated based on the difference between the sale price of an asset and its cost basis (generally, the original purchase price plus acquisition costs).&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;The tax rate depends on how long you held the asset before it was liquidated. If held for more than a year, the gain may&amp;nbsp; qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower than short-term rates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan repayment&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repaying the principal amount of the loan using cash (i.e., fiat) is generally not a taxable event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Reporting requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any gains from the liquidation of collateral must be reported on your tax return.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you need cash to cover unexpected expenses, for an investment opportunity, or to diversify your portfolio, a crypto-backed loan can provide the financial flexibility you need while keeping your crypto holdings intact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto-backed loans often come with lower interest rates compared to traditional unsecured loans, and they typically don&amp;rsquo;t require credit checks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of getting a crypto-backed loan? &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/borrow/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=cta-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ultimate-guide\&quot;&gt;Apply today&lt;/a&gt; at Figure Markets!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything you need to know about crypto loans&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1501],&quot;width&quot;:[0,4800]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-10T21:47:05+01:00&quot;]}]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-03-21T17:20:34+00:00&quot;],&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/figuring-out-the-future-with-figure&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1711041599-markets-annoucement-blog-01-1.png&quot;]}],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets, a spinout from Figure, is pursuing the “Exchange for Everything” – a blockchain native, decentralized custody exchange for digital assets.&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figuring Out the Future with Figure&quot;]}],&quot;multipleBlockContent&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;disclaimerGroup&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Default Long&quot;],&quot;disclaimerType&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks.

Figure is rebranding to Figure Technology Solutions and will continue to innovate in the private credit and capital markets spaces. I will be CEO of both companies, and June will be President of Figure Markets and an advisor to Figure Technology Solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;font-medium tracking-tight pt-2\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;font-medium tracking-tight pt-2\&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=\&quot;\&quot;&gt;Figure has been a pioneer in using blockchain to facilitate efficiencies and opportunities in real- world-assets, having recorded over $30B in loan and securities transactions on chain. We built Provenance Blockchain, a decentralized proof of stake blockchain that addresses issues of data control for use specifically in financial services. Provenance is a public blockchain and operates independently of Figure. Figure Markets is our effort to go even further, building a decentralized custody exchange for assets ranging from crypto to public equity to asset-backed-securities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;font-medium tracking-tight pt-2\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;font-medium tracking-tight pt-2\&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=\&quot;\&quot;&gt;The foundation of Figure Markets is a decentralized custody marketplace using a combination of multi-party computation (MPC) wallets and on-chain security perfection. With MPC, Figure Markets doesn&amp;rsquo;t take possession of assets, but can offer cross collateralization and market leading netting and margining. We are launching the onshore marketplace in April, and the offshore exchange later in Q2. We have a steering committee of market makers and buy-side firms contributing time and effort in building out our marketplace, including providing the deep, two way liquid markets. We want to capture what was great about, but never repeat the failures of, FTX.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;font-medium tracking-tight pt-2\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;font-medium tracking-tight pt-2\&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=\&quot;\&quot;&gt;In addition to the exchange, Figure Markets will provide crypto-backed loans and asset management products that are native to blockchain. Many users will be able to invest in a product like Figure Market&amp;rsquo;s REIT and use that to collateralize a trade in BTC. We are also continuing our efforts to create the first interest-bearing stablecoin alternative registered with the SEC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;font-medium tracking-tight pt-2\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;font-medium tracking-tight pt-2\&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=\&quot;\&quot;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve secured over $60 million in a series A financing for Figure Markets, led by Jump Crypto, Faction and Pantera Capital with participation from Distributed Global, Ribbit Capital, CMT Digital and others.

It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that the crypto community &amp;ndash; emboldened by the spirit of democratization of finance &amp;ndash; got burned by centralized bad actors. We&amp;rsquo;ve tried to find ways to give back to that community, most recently in our bid to restart the FTX exchange, making creditors owners in Figure Markets. While it looks like the debtors have abandoned that exchange restart, we believe there are ways we can accomplish the same outcome for those impacted by the bankruptcy. We&amp;rsquo;re working through the logistics, but we intend to find a way to make the original FTX creditors owners in Figure Markets.

One exciting development is the rise of crypto loans, also known as cryptocurrency loans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a crypto loan, you can borrow a traditional currency (like USD or EUR) or a stablecoin (like USDC) by using your cryptocurrency as collateral just like you would use other assets - like a house or a car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This concept brings more flexibility and a unique opportunity to leverage existing crypto assets to secure financing. But how exactly do crypto loans work? What are the benefits and risks involved? And how do crypto loans compare to traditional loans?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a seasoned crypto user or just exploring the possibilities, this guide will help you understand everything you need to know about how crypto loans work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Want to explore the world of crypto-backed loans at your own pace?

But don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;mdash;we&amp;rsquo;re here to help. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the most common terms you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter, making it simple and straightforward for you to understand how crypto loans work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;Crypto lending glossary\&quot; title=\&quot;Crypto lending glossery\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642575-crypto-lending-glossary.png\&quot; width=\&quot;772\&quot; height=\&quot;1264\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve familiarized yourself with the most common crypto lending terms, let&amp;rsquo;s understand what crypto-backed loans are and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A crypto loan is a type of secured loan in which you pledge digital assets as collateral to receive a loan in fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR, BRL) or stablecoins (e.g. USDC, USDT). It&amp;rsquo;s similar to a traditional secured loan, like a mortgage or a car loan, in which the asset acts as a security for the lender.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How are crypto loans different from traditional loans?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans that typically require credit checks and extensive paperwork, crypto loans offer a more streamlined and accessible lending process:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No credit checks: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans do not require credit checks. The collateral itself reduces the lender&amp;rsquo;s risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Faster approval: &lt;/b&gt;The process is usually fast and straightforward, with funds often available quickly.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency: &lt;/b&gt;Some crypto loans leverage blockchain technology, offering a decentralized and transparent process that eliminates many of the inefficiencies of conventional banking systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tax benefits: &lt;/b&gt;Crypto-backed loans may provide some borrowers with certain tax benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Types of crypto loans&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cryptocurrency loans: CeFi and DeFi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Centralized finance (CeFi) loans are crypto loans offered by centralized institutions or platforms. Similar to traditional loans, they may be easier to use but require trusting a central entity with your crypto.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;CeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642854-cefi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decentralized finance (DeFi) loans are cryptocurrency loans managed by smart contracts on a blockchain network, which means no intermediaries. They offer greater transparency, accessibility and, often, lower fees, but come with higher risk and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; title=\&quot;DeFi lending pros and cons\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642863-defi-crypto-lending-pros-and-cons.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing between CeFi and DeFi for crypto loans depends on your preference. CeFi offers ease of use, compliance, and customer support, but at the cost of higher fees and less control. DeFi provides greater control, transparency, and potentially lower fees, but requires technical know-how and carries higher security risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How to get a crypto loan&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to take out a crypto-backed loan, each offering unique advantages to suit different needs. You can choose centralized finance (CeFi) platforms for straightforward, secure loans, or explore decentralized finance (DeFi) options for greater control but require greater technical knowledge to use.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a general overview on how to take out loans on each type of platform. For more specifics, please refer to the specific platform&amp;rsquo;s instructions on their respective websites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a CeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Create an account on a CeFi platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Send collateral&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Borrow funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How to get a crypto loan on a DeFi lending platform&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Set up a crypto wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 2. Install and configure wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Transfer the crypto assets you plan to use as collateral to your wallet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Connect to DeFi lending platform&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Deposit collateral&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Borrow Funds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking out a DeFi crypto loan generally requires more constant monitoring compared to CeFi loans due to the nature of smart contracts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In DeFi, smart contracts are programmed to automatically liquidate collateral if certain conditions, such as a LTV ratio, are met. This automation ensures prompt action but also means that borrowers must vigilantly track the value of their collateral and market conditions to avoid sudden liquidation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike CeFi crypto loans, where there might be more flexibility and time to respond to margin calls, DeFi loans generally offer no such leniency, making continuous monitoring essential to manage the risk of automatic liquidation effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest rates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DeFi crypto loans often come with variable interest rates, which are generally determined based on market demand and supply conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional loans with fixed rates, DeFi loan rates are determined by algorithms within smart contracts that adjust in real time. This variability can lead to opportunities for lower interest payments during periods of high liquidity but also carries the risk of rising rates during times of increased borrowing demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You must be aware of these fluctuations and manage your loans accordingly, as the dynamic nature of DeFi interest rates can impact the overall cost and feasibility of maintaining your positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Taking it all in?

If the value of your crypto collateral drops significantly, the lender may issue a margin call and require you to deposit additional collateral to maintain the agreed LTV ratio. If you fail to do so, they might liquidate your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all lenders issue margin calls, and in some cases, collateral may be automatically liquidated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes down in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin falls to $20,000, the value of your collateral decreases to $20,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio increases to 50%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has dropped. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral decrease in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643144-crypto-collateral-value-decrease.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An increase in the LTV ratio indicates higher risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth less relative to the loan amount. If the LTV ratio exceeds a certain threshold, such as 70-80%, the lender may issue a margin call, requiring you to add more collateral or repay part of the loan. Failure to meet the margin call could result in the lender liquidating your collateral to cover the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What happens to my loan if my crypto collateral goes up in value?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario in which you take out a $10,000 loan backed by 1 Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. At the time of the loan, the price of Bitcoin is $30,000, resulting in an initial Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 33.33%. This is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if the price of Bitcoin rises to $50,000, the value of your collateral increases to $50,000. Consequently, the LTV ratio decreases to 20%, as the loan amount remains the same while the value of the collateral has increased. This new LTV ratio is also calculated by dividing the loan amount by the new value of the collateral and multiplying by 100.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; title=\&quot;what happens if my crypto collateral increases in value throughout my loan\&quot; src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720643110-crypto-collateral-value-increase.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A decrease in the LTV ratio indicates lower risk for the lender because the collateral is now worth more relative to the loan amount. This increased security reduces the likelihood of a margin call or the need for additional collateral. Additionally, you may be eligible to borrow more funds against the increased value of your Bitcoin collateral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What are the U.S. federal tax implications of taking out a crypto-backed loan?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When considering taking out a crypto-backed loan in the United States, it&#39;s important to understand the potential tax implications. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of key considerations. This is not tax, legal, or investment advice, and applicable tax rules and guidance are subject to change, please consult with tax professional:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Receiving the loan&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally, receiving proceeds from a loan, including a crypto-backed loan, is not considered a taxable event. You do not incur a tax liability on the loan amount received when you open the loan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Interest payments&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interest payments on a crypto-backed loan may or may not be deductible. If the loan is used for investment purposes, the interest may qualify as a deductible expense. However, if the loan is used for personal purposes, the interest is typically not deductible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Collateral liquidation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;If your collateral is liquidated to repay the loan, this triggers a taxable event. You may owe capital gains tax if the value of the cryptocurrency has increased since your purchase date. The gain is generally calculated based on the difference between the sale price of an asset and its cost basis (generally, the original purchase price plus acquisition costs).&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;The tax rate depends on how long you held the asset before it was liquidated. If held for more than a year, the gain may&amp;nbsp; qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower than short-term rates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Loan repayment&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Repaying the principal amount of the loan using cash (i.e., fiat) is generally not a taxable event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Reporting requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any gains from the liquidation of collateral must be reported on your tax return.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you need cash to cover unexpected expenses, for an investment opportunity, or to diversify your portfolio, a crypto-backed loan can provide the financial flexibility you need while keeping your crypto holdings intact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crypto-backed loans often come with lower interest rates compared to traditional unsecured loans, and they typically don&amp;rsquo;t require credit checks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div classname=\&quot;col-span-full text-center py-5 px-6 rounded-sm border border-neutral-150 mt-6\&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thinking of getting a crypto-backed loan? &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/borrow/?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=cta-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ultimate-guide\&quot;&gt;Apply today&lt;/a&gt; at Figure Markets!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,&quot;Everything you need to know about crypto loans&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1720642549-everything-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-loans.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1501],&quot;width&quot;:[0,4800]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-10T21:47:05+01:00&quot;]}]}],[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/markets-on-markets-v1&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets on Markets: BTC &amp; ETH Near All-Time Highs, FTX Update, New US Crypto Bill (FIT21)&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Dive into market analysis of Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum price movements, the latest on FTX, and the potential impact of the new FIT21 Act on crypto regulations.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets on Markets - volume 1&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;May 2024 Recap&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Mike Abbate, Chief Investment Officer, and Jesse Yuan, Senior Research Analyst&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Figure Markets on the Markets, a newsletter where we provide commentary and insights on the ever-evolving world of traditional and decentralized financial markets. In this edition, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the current state of BTC and ETH markets, updates on the latest developments at FTX, and recent regulatory and policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;BTC and ETH Strength\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;BTC nears all-time highs and ETH rallies - 20% in the days leading up to the SEC&#39;s potential approval of spot ETH ETFs in the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;FTX Updates\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;FTX&#39;s updated disclosure statement&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; estimates $11.2bn of allowable claims with estimated customer recoveries to be between 119% and 143%.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Regulatory and Policy\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act(\&quot;FIT21\&quot;) aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the US, though it faces challenges in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;BTC and ETH Markets&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTC and ETH are holding just below their all-time highs following the SEC&amp;rsquo;s approval of eight 19-4b filings&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to list spot ETH ETFs on May 23rd, which triggered a ~20% rally in ETH price.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To better understand potential future ETH price action, we look at historical BTC price movement which rallied 54% in the five months since the spot BTC ETF began trading.&amp;nbsp; Demand for spot BTC ETFs has been strong with net inflows of approximately $14bn (see Exhibit 1) since January 2024. Currently, these ETFs hold over $59bn or 835k BTC, representing nearly 8% of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s active supply&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This follows the April halving, which reduced BTC&amp;rsquo;s yearly supply from 328,500 to 164,250.&amp;nbsp; The wrinkle worth noting when comparing BTC and ETH ETFs revolves around staking. Certain issuers such as Fidelity and Franklin Templeton have removed staking from the ETH ETFs due to regulatory pressures. &lt;b&gt;Spot ETH ETFs that omit staking will have an increased opportunity cost of holding ETH through an ETF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhibit 1: Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Ticker&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Total Flows&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;June 3 AUM&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Seed Capital&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;IBIT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,669.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20,146.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$10.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;FBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$8,977.4&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$11,418.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$20.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BITB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,984.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,555.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$200.0&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ARKB&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2,490&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$3,270.6&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.4&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCO&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$318.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$504.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$5.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BRRR&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$511.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$592.8&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;EZBC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$362.0&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$424.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.6&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;HODL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$524.1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$691.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$72.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTCW&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$70.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$89.2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$2.5&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;GBTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;-$17,875.9&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$19,712.5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$28,581.1&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total Net Flow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$14,032.6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$59,406.8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;$28,894.7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we at the end of the short term bull market or somewhere in the middle? The MVRV ratio would suggest the latter.&amp;nbsp; Many traders look at what is called the MVRV ratio as an indication of bull and bear markets.&amp;nbsp; MVRV measures the current market cap of a token over the last traded price of a token. Historically, buy signals exist when the ratio approaches one (not many people have trading gains to monetize), and sell signals appear when the ratio trends above three (an indication most people are buying the local highs). At the end of May 2024, MVRV for ETH was 2.12&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, pretty much smack in the middle of the historical buy / sell range.&amp;nbsp; We believe that MVRV will continue to rise as spot ETFs purchases move tokens &amp;ldquo;off exchange&amp;rdquo; while token supply has generally been deflationary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: BTC and ETH MVRV&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718642911-btc_and_eth_mvrv.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Circulating ETH Supply&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718640654-eth_supply.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTX Claims&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The FTX estate released its much anticipated Chapter 11 Plan with an expected effective date of 10/31/24. FTX holds nearly $9.9bn in cash and $1.4bn in digital assets (digital assets are marked at petition prices) as of 4/30/24&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. During the month, FTX received payments for their Anthropic sale of $884mm&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. An additional $2.7bn in cash is expected to be received from the monetization of assets before the end of October, bringing the total estimated cash to ~$12.6bn. After the effective date, another $2.5bn to $4.3bn of assets are expected to be monetized for cash. In total, the estate expects to have &lt;b&gt;$15.1bn to $16.9bn&lt;/b&gt; of net distributed assets.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The estate currently estimates $11.2bn of allowable claims with estimated customer recoveries, after netting out priority claims, to be between 119% and 143% (see Exhibit 4) of their Petition Date claim values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: FTX Recoveries&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Estimated Percent Recovery&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 5A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Customer&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;129% - 143%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Class 7A/B:&amp;nbsp; FTX.com &amp;amp; FTX.US Convenience Class&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;119%&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite these seemingly strong results, it is important to note that the claim values are calculated as of petition date prices (see Exhibit 5). Therefore, if a customer had one bitcoin on the platform at filing, his / her claim would only be for $16,871 dollars not for the $70,000 dollars where bitcoin is trading today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: FTX Petition Date Prices&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Asset&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Petition Price&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16,871.63&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;ETH&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1,258.84&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;SOL&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$16.2471144&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;USDT&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$0.9975910&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a BTC denominated claim would need a 415% recovery for a creditor to receive a comparable amount of value back.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;A creditor that had SOL on the platform would need a 1,000% recovery to break even.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers should expect to wait until at least December of 2024 or early 2025 before they receive their claim distributions, subject to completion of KYC and necessary distribution information materials. Claims volumes and prices have continued to increase as customer demand for immediate liquidity on their claims rises and buyers feel more confidence in recoveries as the estate continues to monetize its assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory and Policy Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SEC remains hawkish on the space and continues to regulate through enforcement. In May 2024, Robinhood received a &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000178387924000138/hood-20240504.htm\&quot;&gt;Wells notice&lt;/a&gt; that the SEC had made a &amp;ldquo;preliminary determination&amp;rdquo; that Robinhood had violated securities law as an unregistered securities broker. The SEC made similar allegations concerning Coinbase&amp;rsquo;s activities.&amp;nbsp; The complaint is expected to be filed in the coming months which will provide more details as to the merits of the SEC&amp;rsquo;s allegations and hopefully more clarity on which tokens the SEC thinks are securities and why.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap was also served a Wells notice alleging that the decentralized exchange (DEX) it is operating is an unregistered securities broker and unregistered exchange, and the UNI token is an investment contract.&amp;nbsp; This is an important case to watch as Uniswap has already won a class action lawsuit where Judge Katherine Polk Failla &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2022cv02780/577791/90/0.pdf?ts=1693496494\&quot;&gt;ruled &lt;/a&gt;that Uniswap, by writing the code of the smart contract, was not a &amp;ldquo;seller&amp;rdquo; of tokens and thus not a financial intermediary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uniswap responded&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; on 5/21/24 arguing the Protocol has facilitated over $2tn in transactions and offers significant consumer benefits by eliminating intermediaries, potentially saving American investors $12bn annually if adopted in traditional equity markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amidst these regulatory actions, the recent &lt;a style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot; href=\&quot;https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409277\&quot;&gt;passage&lt;/a&gt; of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the House represents a significant legislative development in the digital assets sector. We expect FIT21 will bring stability and clarity to the digital assets ecosystem since it provides participants with a clear process to determine which digital asset transactions are subject to the SEC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction and the CFTC&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction. Specifically, the CFTC will have jurisdiction over a digital asset as a commodity if the blockchain is functional and decentralized. The bill defines decentralization as: &amp;ldquo;if, among other requirements, no person has unilateral authority to control the blockchain or its usage, and no issuer or affiliated person &lt;b&gt;has control of 20 percent or more of the digital asset or the voting power of the digital asset.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the robust support from 71 Democrats, exceeding expectations, the bill faces considerable hurdles in the Senate. The lack of a Senate companion bill, a tight congressional schedule, and substantial opposition from key figures like Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, make its enactment this year unlikely. Although FIT21 is unlikely to be addressed in the Senate this year, it could lay the groundwork for future legislative efforts post-election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,300],&quot;width&quot;:[0,601]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-17T17:20:35+01:00&quot;]}]}],[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;resource_page&quot;],&quot;slugUrl&quot;:[0,&quot;insights/bitcoin-ai-housing&quot;],&quot;seo&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know | Figure Markets on Markets&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&quot;],&quot;image&quot;:[0,{&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1718639812-figure_markets_on_markets.png&quot;]}]}],&quot;content&quot;:[0,{&quot;_modelApiKey&quot;:[0,&quot;blog_post&quot;],&quot;postType&quot;:[0,{&quot;typeOfResource&quot;:[0,&quot;Insights&quot;]}],&quot;topic&quot;:[0,{&quot;tagName&quot;:[0,&quot;Markets&quot;]}],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing - The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;articleDescription&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;In the latest issue of Figure Markets on Markets issue we cover Bitcoin&#39;s recent price movements, the impact of the AI boom on energy consumption, and the parallels between housing and crypto markets.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;Bitcoin, AI, and Housing -  The Unexpected Connections You Need to Know&quot;],&quot;author&quot;:[0,&quot;Mike Abbate, Chief Investment Officer, and Jesse Yuan, Senior Research Analyst&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Bitcoin selling pressure overstated\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Over the last two weeks, the price of bitcoin, along with the tech heavy NASDAQ composite, declined after Federal Reserve officials &lt;a href=\&quot;https://apnews.com/article/federal-reserve-inflation-prices-interest-rates-cuts-4384e6b128915458aba2d178bf31ee1b\&quot;&gt;signaled&lt;/a&gt; to the market that they anticipate only one interest-rate cut for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;As the interest in AI remains at fever pitch, we call attention to the less advertised dilemma for the AI industry; where to plug in the computers to train the AI models.&amp;nbsp; The AI industry has much to learn from the bitcoin mining industry in this respect and we see an eventual alignment of the two technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8; font-weight: bold;\&quot;&gt;Housing prices hit all-time highs&lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The housing market is experiencing unprecedented price increases&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; due to a severe supply-demand imbalance which we expect to continue. Scarcity is a common thread that runs between the US housing market and the crypto market worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin selling pressure overstated&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although it is difficult to point to any single catalyst for the selling pressure for bitcoin, we highlight two. The first being the obvious jawboning from Fed officials after their June meeting to walk back rate cuts later this year. Given the Feds historical performance, we do not give much credence to any of their projections.&amp;nbsp; Below is the chart from three years ago, with their prediction for rates in 2024.&amp;nbsp; As Lloyd Christmas once said, &amp;ldquo;I was way off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 1: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of June 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955171-fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 2: Implied Fed Funds Target Rate as of December 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955290-june_fed_funds.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, after years of shifting deadlines, Mt. Gox, a former bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20240624_announcement_en.pdf\&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on June 24, 2024, that it would begin repayments to creditors starting in July, 2024. Bitcoin prices immediately dropped due to anticipated selling pressure following the repayments. Although it is unclear how much Mt. Gox will distribute to customers, Mt. Gox &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1JbezDVd9VsK9o1Ga9UqLydeuEvhKLAPs6\&quot;&gt;transferred&lt;/a&gt; around 142,000 bitcoin (or ~$8.8bn&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) to an unknown wallet last week, possibly as part of the plan to repay creditors. We expect many of the creditors will likely monetize their repayments since their bitcoin was acquired at a relatively low cost basis (bitcoin was priced ~$300&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; at the end of 2014). We believe selling pressure may be overstated though - assuming all of the transferred $8.8bn bitcoin is monetized, it only represents &amp;lt;1% of total monthly trading volumes. Some rough math based on trading statistics&amp;nbsp; from May:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 3: Bitcoin May Trading Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Instrument&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;5/24 Trading Volumes&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC perps &amp;amp; futures&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$1.53tn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC options&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$50.2bn&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC spot&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$41bn&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;BTC ETF&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;$250mm&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1.62tn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Conclusion: even if all $8.8bn of bitcoin is sold, the selling pressure is a drop in a bucket given the global liquidity of bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Going beyond disproving bearish technicals, it is worth highlighting the bullish ones.&amp;nbsp; Historically, supply and demand mechanics are favorable following halving events, which we just experienced in April. Bitcoin prices experienced significant run ups of approximately 10x, 2x, and 7x in each of the last three halvings&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, VanEck&amp;rsquo;s filing on June 27, 2024 to sell shares in a SOL ETF resulted in an immediate surge in the price of SOL, rising from $136 to a peak of $149. However, we are skeptical of approval under the current administration due to the SEC&#39;s stance that SOL is a security in its &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf\&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Binance last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Convergence of AI and Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do AI models and Bitcoin miners have in common? More than most people realize. Both rely heavily on data centers, which require two basic commodities: computer chips and electricity. Globally, the number of data centers has surged to over 7,000, up from 3,600 in 2015&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. This trend has caused expectations of power demand in the US to grow by 40% over the next two decades, compared to just 9% growth over the past 20 years&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally, data centers are located near low-cost, renewable energy sources.&amp;nbsp; However, the cheapest electricity is typically located in remote areas, making it less than ideal for more traditional data centers due to latency concerns. Additionally, the lowest-cost, baseload sources of energy cannot not be easily turned on or off which does not deal well with fluctuating demand.&amp;nbsp; Finally, renewable energy tends to be intermittent; the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin miners have had to deal with these issues and have done so successfully by employing demand response programs: mining when energy demand is low and shutting down when demand is high. The added benefit is this load balancing uses otherwise wasted energy and helps stabilize energy grids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AI providers are facing the same difficulties and finding great value in partnering with bitcoin miners to leverage their infrastructure and expertise. Many pure-play Bitcoin miners are expanding into or partnering with high-power compute service providers. For example, Core Scientific &lt;a href=\&quot;https://investors.corescientific.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/78/core-scientific-announces-new-contract-with-coreweave-for-delivery-of-approximately-70-mw-of-additional-infrastructure-to-host-high-performance-computing-operations\&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a 12-year, $3.5bn contract to procure over 270 MW of power dedicated to AI training with CoreWeave. Hut 8 &lt;a href=\&quot;https://hut8.com/2024/06/24/hut-8-announces-150-million-strategic-investment-from-coatue-to-partner-in-building-next-generation-ai-infrastructure-platform/\&quot;&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; a $150mm investment from Coatue to develop next-generation AI infrastructure. We believe this trend will continue, with renewable data centers and baseload generators paired with AI training and Bitcoin mining operations, optimizing energy use by training or mining when power prices are low and supplying power to the grid when prices are high.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Housing prices hit all time high&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p classname=\&quot;text-center py-4\&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&quot;Buy land, they are not making any more of it\&quot; - Mark Twain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The National Association of Realtors &lt;a href=\&quot;https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-edged-lower-by-0-7-in-may-as-median-sales-price-reached-record-high-of-419300\&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in May that median housing prices reached its all-time highs in the face of the highest rates in 25 years. How could this be? The answer is simple: supply and demand.&amp;nbsp; In the US, there is a cumulative housing gap of ~6.8mm homes and homeowner mobility is at all-time lows due to relatively low-rates on existing mortgages coupled with concurrent rise in aforementioned financing costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 4: Housing Supply and Demand Mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955923-housing_mismatch.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit 5: Low Homeowner Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1719955952-market-commentary.png\&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are constantly looking for the common themes that tie real assets to digitally native assets on decentralized blockchains: scarcity is one of our favorites.

However, this shift comes with a number of challenges. Central to these challenges is the management of private keys used to create the digital signatures required to access, control, and manage digital assets in the investor&amp;rsquo;s blockchain accounts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prevalent&amp;nbsp;approaches to key management offer a binary choice&amp;mdash;centralized or decentralized solutions&amp;mdash;each with its own set of limitations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized solutions&lt;/strong&gt;, including &lt;b&gt;custodial wallets&lt;/b&gt; offered by many cryptocurrency exchanges, provide convenient key management to investors. However, these solutions entrust key management to exchanges or custodians who sign blockchain transactions on the investors&amp;rsquo; behalf.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized solutions&lt;/strong&gt;, including &lt;b&gt;self-custody wallets&lt;/b&gt;, give investors complete ownership of their private keys, promoting a self-directed and autonomous experience. While this approach eliminates reliance on custodians by allowing only the owners of self-custody wallets to sign blockchain transactions, it places a security burden on investors and increases the risk of permanent loss of digital assets. For instance, an investor may misplace private keys (or equivalent mnemonic seed phrases) by losing access to their mobile device or computer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\&quot;p1\&quot;&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;Markets addresses challenges with asset custody on centralized exchanges through an unique implementation of multi-party custody (MPC) technology. Through our MPC methodology, investors remain in control of their assets through self-custody with the added reassurance that keys are not easily misplaced, all while taking advantage of trading efficiencies traditionally limited to custodial-only exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;/Whitepaper-Multi-Computation-Technology.pdf\&quot; download=\&quot;Whitepaper-Multi-Computation-Technology.pdf\&quot; style=\&quot;color: #5d57f8;\&quot;&gt;Download Whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;],&quot;postImage&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;markets-whitepaper_linkedin-header.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1712170843-markets-whitepaper_linkedin-header.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,627],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1200]}],&quot;_firstPublishedAt&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-04-01T03:52:40+01:00&quot;]}],&quot;relatedResources&quot;:[1,[]]}]]],&quot;allDisclaimerGroups&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets Launched Industry First Yield-Bearing Stablecoin as an SEC Registered Public Security&quot;],&quot;disclaimerType&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks.
