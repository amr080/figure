Some features of the Service may require that you link to your Account one or more supported blockchain-based digital asset accounts or account storage software applications (each a “**Digital Wallet**”). By linking any Digital Wallet to your Account, you (a) certify that you are the owner of that linked Digital Wallet or that you have appropriate permission or consent from the Digital Wallet owner(s) to link the Digital Wallet; (b) agree that any Digital Wallet information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times; (c) acknowledge that Figure is not responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Digital Wallet or for restricting access to it, and that use of that Digital Wallet is governed by the service and privacy terms of the provider, host, or creator of, or entity that makes available for use to you, that Digital Wallet, if any; and (d) you accept responsibility for all activities that occur in your Account through use of your linked Digital Wallet. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (c) &lt;ins&gt;Consent to Access, Processing and Storage of Your Personal Data&lt;/ins&gt;. During registration for your Account, or for any Additional Service (such as a Figure Wallet (as defined in Appendix B), or at any other time deemed necessary by Figure, you agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification, providing the Service to you, and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crimes and permit us to keep a record of such information. The information we request may include certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification, and information regarding your bank account (such as the name of the bank, the account type, routing number, and account number) and in some cases (where permitted by law), special categories of personal data, such as your biometric information. You consent to us accessing, processing and retaining any personal information you provide to us for the purpose of us providing the Service to you. This consent is not related to, and does not affect, any rights or obligations we or you have in accordance with data protection laws, privacy laws and regulations. You can withdraw your consent at any time by closing your Account. However, we may retain and continue to process your personal information if we reasonably believe it is necessary in order to comply with laws or regulations. In providing us with this or any other information that may be required, you confirm that the information is accurate and authentic. You agree to keep us updated if any of the information you provide changes. You authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries. When we carry out these inquiries, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be disclosed to credit reference and fraud prevention or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in full. This is an identity check only and should have no adverse effect on your credit rating. We reserve the right at all times to monitor, review, retain and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, sanctions programs, legal process or governmental request. Further, you authorize your wireless operator to disclose your phone number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, Device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber and Device details, if available, to Figure and Figure Payments and our service providers until these Terms are terminated, solely for identity verification and fraud avoidance.

Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are final and non-refundable. You agree to pay any fees that apply to your account. Fees may be deducted or set off from your account balance without prior notice to you. \n\n\nFigure reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service, including any features of the Service or products offered through the Service. Figure will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on our website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Figure may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Figure gives you advance notice of changes before they apply.  Figure will also notify you of the final price of each transaction, inclusive of pricing and fees, when you authorize a transaction and in each receipt we issue to you. Figure, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Figure’s users and merchants. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms. You authorize Figure to charge all sums for any Use of your Account that you confirm through the Service (including through features of the Service, such as QR codes), any orders you make, and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Figure, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your Account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Figure may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase or requested transmission of funds in or out of your Account. Figure may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (e) &lt;ins&gt;Reversals and Cancellations&lt;/ins&gt;.  You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful, if your payment method has insufficient funds, or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize Figure, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including your Digital Wallet, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction, which may include additional fees or transaction spreads. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (f) &lt;ins&gt;Third-Party Services and Software&lt;/ins&gt;.

Third-party services are not under Figure’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Figure is not responsible for any third-party service’s use of your exported information. The Service may also contain links to third-party websites. Linked websites are not under Figure’s control, and Figure is not responsible for their content. The Service may include or incorporate third-party software components that are generally available free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute those components. Although the Service is provided to you subject to these Terms, nothing in these Terms prevents, restricts, or is intended to prevent or restrict you from obtaining those third-party components under the applicable third-party licenses or to limit your use of those third-party components under those third-party licenses.\n2. **Licenses and Ownership**. \n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (a) &lt;ins&gt;Licenses to Service&lt;/ins&gt;. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Figure grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to: (a) install and use one object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Service obtained from a legitimate marketplace (whether installed by you or pre-installed on your mobile device by the device manufacturer) on a mobile device that you own or control (“**Device**”); and (b) access and use the Service, solely for User’s personal, non-commercial use or solely for Company’s internal business purposes, as applicable.

You acknowledge, consent, and agree that Figure may access, preserve, and disclose content you provide us if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is permitted by our Privacy Policy or reasonably necessary or appropriate for any of the following reasons: (1) to comply with legal process (e.g., a subpoena, court order, or warrant); (2) to enforce these Terms; (3) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (4) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Blend, our agents and affiliates, our users, and the public; or (5) to address your requests.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (d) &lt;ins&gt;Feedback&lt;/ins&gt;.

The Service is owned and operated by Figure. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service (including of Your Account) (collectively, “**Materials**”) provided by Figure are protected by intellectual property and other laws.

YOUR POSSESSION, PERMITTED TRANSFER, AND USE OF ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING YOUR ACCOUNT) IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICE AND YOUR ACCOUNT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, FIGURE AND ALL FIGURE ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING: (I) WARRANTIES OF COMPANY ABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, NON-INTERFERENCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE AND YOUR ACCOUNT; AND (II) WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICE AND YOUR ACCOUNT, AND ANY DATA PROCESSED THROUGH OR USING THE SERVICE IS SECURE, ACCURATE, FREE FROM BUGS, VIRUSES, INTERRUPTION, ERRORS, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION. IF ANY OF THESE EXCLUSIONS DO NOT APPLY TO YOU OR ARE VOID WITH RESPECT TO YOU UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THEN ANY WARRANTY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED IS LIMITED TO THE SHORTER OF: (A) 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FIRST DELIVERY OF THE SERVICE; AND (B) THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.\nNONE OF FIGURE, ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, PROVIDERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR LICENSORS GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY, TIMELINESS, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, SUITABILITY, AVAILABILITY OR USEFULNESS OF ANY OF THE SERVICES, FOR ANY PURPOSE, AND EACH OF THESE PERSONS DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE SERVICES. NONE OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES AN OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY OR SELL ANY SECURITY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY TRADING STRATEGY. THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE RELIED UPON AS THE BASIS FOR ANY INVESTMENT DECISION. THE SERVICES ARE NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS LEGAL, BUSINESS, OR TAX ADVICE, AND YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN ATTORNEY, BUSINESS ADVISOR, AND/OR TAX ADVISOR IN ORDER TO MAKE AN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION OF THE SUITABILITY AND LEGAL, BUSINESS, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ANY ACTION. THE SERVICES MAY BE TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE FROM TIME TO TIME FOR MAINTENANCE OR OTHER REASONS. FIGURE ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DELETION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMMUNICATIONS LINE FAILURE, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, OR ALTERATION OF, USER COMMUNICATIONS.

THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THESE TERMS.\n9. **Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate**.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (a) &lt;ins&gt;Generally&lt;/ins&gt;. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Figure in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 9(b) and 9(d), you and Figure agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FIGURE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (b) &lt;ins&gt;Exceptions&lt;/ins&gt;. Despite the provisions of Section 9(a), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (c) &lt;ins&gt;Opt-Out&lt;/ins&gt;. If you are a User and do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 9 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Figure Technologies, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“**Opt-Out Notice**”). Once Figure receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 9 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 10(b). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. Only a User, and in no event a Company, may exercise this opt-out right.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (d) &lt;ins&gt;Arbitrator&lt;/ins&gt;. Any arbitration between you and Figure will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “**AAA Rules**”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](www.adr.org)  Opens a new window., by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Figure. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (e) &lt;ins&gt;Notice of Arbitration; Process&lt;/ins&gt;. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration is: Figure Technologies, Inc., P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Figure may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Figure must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (f) &lt;ins&gt;Fees&lt;/ins&gt;. If you are a User and commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Figure will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Figure for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (g) &lt;ins&gt;No Class Actions&lt;/ins&gt;. YOU AND FIGURE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Figure agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (h) &lt;ins&gt;Modifications to this Arbitration Provision&lt;/ins&gt;. If Figure makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Figure will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (i) &lt;ins&gt;Enforceability&lt;/ins&gt;. If you are a User and Section 9(g) is found to be unenforceable or if you are a User or Company and the entirety of this Section 9 is found to be unenforceable, or if Figure receives an Opt-Out Notice from you as a User, then the entirety of this Section 9 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 10(b) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.\n10. **Risk Disclosures and Acknowledgement**. Investing, transacting, and engaging in other activities involving digital assets involves risk and may not be suitable for all users.  \nBy accessing the Service(s), you acknowledge the following risks, which is not intended to be a complete list of all risks related to engaging in digital asset activity:  \nVirtual Currency is not legal tender, it is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation Protections;\nLegislative and regulatory changes or actions at the State, Federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency;\nTransactions in Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;\nSome Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you or we initiate a transaction;\nThe value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear;\nThere is no assurance that a person who accepts a Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future;\nThe volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time;\nThe nature of Virtual Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack;\nThe nature of Virtual Currency means that any technological difficulties we experience may prevent the access or use of your Virtual Currency; and\nAny bond or trust account maintained by Figure for your benefit may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by you and/or other users.\n11.  **Miscellaneous**.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (a) &lt;ins&gt;General Terms&lt;/ins&gt;. These Terms, including  any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Figure regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (b) &lt;ins&gt;Governing Law&lt;/ins&gt;. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Figure submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (c) &lt;ins&gt;Notice to California Residents&lt;/ins&gt;. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, any questions about pricing, complaints, or inquiries must be sent to Figure Technologies, LLC., Attn: Complaints, P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504. You may also contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.

Please be aware that the Services may permit you to access sensitive and confidential information (“Confidential Information”) regarding Figure and its affiliates and their respective clients or customers (“Disclosing Party”), and such information may be subject to existing confidentiality obligations between you and the Disclosing Party, including, by way of example, a written non-disclosure agreement or employee confidentiality agreement (an “NDA”). Nothing in these Terms provides you a right to disclose, or provide access to, any Confidential Information to any third party in violation of your NDA. The Services and its related information is the confidential information of Figure. You will not disclose any features of, or information pertaining to, the Services to any third party without the prior written approval of Figure, except that you will not be liable for the disclosure of any information which is: (a) in the public domain other than by a breach of these Terms by you; (b) rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; (c) rightfully known to you without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to its receipt from Figure; or (d) generally made available to third parties by Figure without restriction on disclosure. You will immediately notify, and cooperate fully with Figure in the event you discover or suspect any unauthorized use of or access to the Services and/or Confidential Information. \n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (e) &lt;ins&gt;No Support&lt;/ins&gt;. We are under no obligation to provide support for the Service. In instances where we may offer support, the support will be subject to published policies.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (f) &lt;ins&gt;Notice Regarding Apple&lt;/ins&gt;.

Figure makes available to users Digital Wallets that are “self-custody” or unhosted multi-signature (each, a “Figure Wallet”). The Figure Wallet enables users to (i) purchase, store, transfer, and sell digital assets from a blockchain address on the Provenance Blockchain; (ii) link to certain FIgure and third party applications; (iii) obtain additional functionality as Figure may add to the Wallet from time to time; and (iv) view addresses and information that are part of the Provenance Blockchain (collectively the “Wallet Service”).  Figure developed these Wallet specific Terms of Service (these “Wallet Terms”) to describe the terms that govern your use of all versions of the Wallet and the Service.\n\n2. **Digital Wallet Eligibility**. You may use the Wallet Service if you are 18 years or older and are not barred from using the Wallet Service under applicable law.  We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to open a Figure Wallet, suspend or terminate any Figure Wallet, suspend or terminate the sending of digital assets from your Figure Wallet, or suspend or terminate the trading of digital assets in your Figure Wallet. Residents of, or businesses based in, New York, are not eligible or authorized to use a Figure Wallet.\n\n3. **Ownership and Control**. You own and control the digital assets held in your Figure Wallet. As the sole owner of digital assets in your Figure Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such digital assets. You agree that Figure shall have no liability for digital asset fluctuations or loss associated with your use of the Figure Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your digital assets by sending them to a different blockchain address.\n\n4. **Registration and Your Information**. If you want to use the Service, you will have to access your Figure Wallet through electronic private keys (the “Keys”) for your Figure Wallet, or your twenty-four word recovery phrase (“Recovery Phrase”), which is used to access the digital assets associated with your Figure Wallet.  Your Keys and Recovery Phrase will be provided to you after you open the Figure Wallet.\n\nYou are solely responsible for the retention and security of your Figure Wallet credentials.  Anyone that has access to your Recovery Phrase or your Keys can access your Figure Wallet.  You agree that you won’t disclose your Figure Wallet credentials to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Figure Wallet. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Figure Wallet, or are otherwise referable to your FIgure Wallet, whether or not you know about them.  We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your FIgure Wallet, including if you provide inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or if you fail to comply with the Figure Wallet registration requirements or these Terms.\n\nIF YOU LOSE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE OR YOUR KEYS, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANY DIGITAL ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR FIGURE WALLET. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FIGURE DOES NOT STORE AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR THE SECURITY OF YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE OR YOUR KEYS.  YOU AGREE TO HOLD FIGURE AND ITS AFFILIATES HARMLESS FOR ANY LOSSES ARISING FROM YOU LOSING YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE OR YOUR KEYS. YOU AGREE THAT FIGURE AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY IF YOU LOSE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE OR YOUR KEYS AND CANNOT ACCESS YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS.\n\n5. **Delegation of Keys**. You may be able to delegate the Keys associated with your Figure Wallet to  a third party through the Service.  If you do so, you will be able to access your Figure Wallet through an access procedure provided by that third party. \n**IF THE THIRD PARTY LOSES, MISUSES, CORRUPTS, DAMAGES, DESTROYS, OR PREVENTS YOU FROM ACCESSING  YOUR KEYS IN ANY OTHER MANNER, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANY DIGITAL ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THE FIGURE WALLET.  YOU AGREE THAT FIGURE DOES NOT STORE AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR THE SECURITY OF ANY KEYS YOU HAVE DELEGATED TO ANY OTHER PARTY.

YOU AGREE THAT FIGURE AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY IF A THIRD PARTY LOSES, MISUSES, CORRUPTS, DAMAGES DESTROYS, OR PREVENTS YOU FROM ACCESSING YOUR KEYS IN ANY OTHER MANNER AND YOU CANNOT ACCESS YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS**.\n6. **Acknowledgement of Risk**. As with any asset, the value of digital assets can increase or decrease and there can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying, selling, holding, or investing in digital assets. You should consult your financial advisor, legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation and financial condition and carefully consider whether trading or holding digital assets is suitable for you.

As part of the Services, we will allow qualifying users to transfer supported and accepted Digital Assets to an account for holding Digital Assets (a “Digital Asset Wallet”) that is connected to the Services. Your Digital Asset Wallet allows you to store, track, transfer and manage your balances of Digital Assets. The private keys, which are used to process transactions, are split using multiparty computation technology and distributed across multiple nodes on a decentralized network (“MPC Nodes”), requiring adherence to a policy that requires multi-party acknowledgment to assemble the full key necessary to complete all transactions.\n6. **Supported Digital Assets**. Your Digital Asset Wallet is intended solely for proper use of Digital Assets that are supported by the Services. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Digital Asset Wallet to store, send, request or receive any assets other than supported Digital Assets. We assume no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use your Digital Asset Wallet with Digital Assets that we do not support or Digital Assets that we do support on an unsupported blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that Figure Markets is not liable for any unsupported Digital Asset that is sent to a wallet associated with your account. You acknowledge and agree that Figure Markets is not liable for a Digital Asset that is sent to a wallet associated with your account via an unsupported network or blockchain.  \nWe may in our sole discretion terminate support for any particular Digital Asset. If you do not sell or send such Digital Asset off platform before we terminate support for such Digital Asset, then we may, in our discretion, remove such Digital Asset from your Digital Asset Wallet and credit your account with the equivalent market value of a supported Digital Asset or other asset minus transaction costs.\n7. **Fungibility of Certain Digital Assets**.  You agree that all forms of the same Digital Asset that may be held and made available across multiple blockchain protocols may be treated as fungible and the equivalent of each other, without regard to: (a) whether any form of such Digital Asset is wrapped; or (b) the blockchain protocol on which any form of such Digital Asset is stored.\n8. **Operation of Digital Asset Protocols**. We do not own or control the underlying software protocols that govern the operation of Digital Assets. Generally, the underlying protocols are open source, and anyone can use, copy, modify and distribute them. We assume no responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and do not guarantee the functionality or security of network operations. In particular, the underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (including “forks”). Any such operating changes may materially affect the availability, value, functionality and/or the name of the Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet or other wallet. We do not control the timing and features of these operating changes. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes and you must carefully consider publicly available information and information that may be provided by us in determining whether to continue to use a Figure Markets account for the affected Digital Asset. In the event of any such operational change, we reserve the right to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the security and safety of assets maintained via the Services, including without limitation, temporarily suspending operations for the involved Digital Asset(s); we will endeavor to provide you notice of our response to any material operating change, however, such changes are outside of our control and may occur without notice to us. Our response to any operating change is subject to our sole discretion and may include deciding not to support any new Digital Asset, fork or other actions. You acknowledge and accept the risks of operating changes to Digital Asset protocols and agree that we are not responsible for such operating changes and not liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result of such changes in operating rules. You acknowledge and accept that we have sole discretion to determine our response to any operating change and that we have no responsibility to assist you with unsupported cryptocurrencies or protocols. You further acknowledge and accept that we have no responsibility to support new Digital Asset forks or operating changes for Digital Assets.\n9. **Digital Asset Ownership**.  All Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet are owned by you, as described in further detail below.\n10. **Ownership and Title**. Title to Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to Figure Markets or to the operators of any MPC Nodes. All interests in Digital Assets held for Digital Asset Wallets are held for customers; they are not the property of Figure Markets or the operators of MPC Nodes, nor are they subject to claims of the creditors thereof. As owner of the Digital Assets credited to your Digital Asset Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. Figure Markets shall have no liability for Digital Asset fluctuations or loss. None of the supported Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, Figure Markets or the operators of any MPC Nodes; neither Figure Markets nor the operators of any MPC Nodes represent or treat assets in your Digital Asset Wallet as belonging to Figure Markets or the operators of any MPC Nodes. Neither Figure Markets nor the operators of any MPC Nodes may grant a security interest in the supported Digital Assets held in your Digital Asset Wallet. Except as required by law, or as provided herein, neither Figure Markets nor the operators of any MPC Nodes will sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate or otherwise alienate supported Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet unless instructed by you.\n11. **Application of the Uniform Commercial Code**. All Digital Assets credited to the Digital Asset Wallet will be treated as “financial assets” under Division 8 of the California Uniform Commercial Code (“Division 8”). Figure Markets is a “securities intermediary” as used in Division 8 with respect to Digital Assets, and your Digital Asset Wallet is a “securities account” as used in Division 8. As stated in Division 8, “the characterization of a person, business, or transaction for purposes of this division does not determine the characterization of the person, business, or transaction for purposes of any other law, regulation, or rule,” including the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and any federal, state or foreign securities laws, rules or regulations. We will execute your instructions with respect to your Digital Assets, subject to these Terms. \n12. **Control and Customer Instructions**. You control the Digital Assets held in your Digital Asset Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, protocol requirements, time to conduct blockchain operations to fulfill your request and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your supported Digital Assets by sending an instruction through the Services to transfer the applicable supported Digital Asset from your Digital Asset Wallet to a different blockchain address. The private keys, which are used to process transactions for the Digital Assets, will be split across MPC Nodes on a decentralized network.\n13. **Omnibus Accounts**. In order to more securely and effectively operate the Services, shared blockchain addresses, controlled by the operators of MPC Nodes, may be used to transfer supported Digital Assets. Nevertheless, Figure Markets will maintain ledgers for each user’s account.  \n14. **Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability**.

In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees.</p>
<p class="font-medium tracking-wide py-4">        (e) <ins>Reversals and Cancellations</ins>.  You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful, if your payment method has insufficient funds, or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize Figure, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including your Digital Wallet, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction, which may include additional fees or transaction spreads.</p>
<p class="font-medium tracking-wide py-4">        (f) <ins>Third-Party Services and Software</ins>.

Third-party services are not under Figure’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Figure is not responsible for any third-party service’s use of your exported information. The Service may also contain links to third-party websites. Linked websites are not under Figure’s control, and Figure is not responsible for their content. The Service may include or incorporate third-party software components that are generally available free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute those components. Although the Service is provided to you subject to these Terms, nothing in these Terms prevents, restricts, or is intended to prevent or restrict you from obtaining those third-party components under the applicable third-party licenses or to limit your use of those third-party components under those third-party licenses.

<p class="font-medium tracking-wide py-4"><strong>Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>.
        (a) <ins>Generally</ins>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Figure in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 9(b) and 9(d), you and Figure agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FIGURE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
        (b) <ins>Exceptions</ins>. Despite the provisions of Section 9(a), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
        (c) <ins>Opt-Out</ins>. If you are a User and do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 9 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Figure Technologies, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“<strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>”). Once Figure receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 9 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 10(b). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. Only a User, and in no event a Company, may exercise this opt-out right.
        (d) <ins>Arbitrator</ins>. Any arbitration between you and Figure will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.figuremarkets.com/disclosures/terms-of-service/www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="rounded-sm outline-0 outline-transparent contrast-more:focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:ring-4 focus-visible:ring-primary-500 ring-offset-2 transition duration-300 hover:text-markets-iris underline text-[#0000FF]" node="[object Object]">www.adr.org</a>  Opens a new window., by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Figure. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="font-medium tracking-wide py-4">        (e) <ins>Notice of Arbitration; Process</ins>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong>”). Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration is: Figure Technologies, Inc., P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Figure may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Figure must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.
        (f) <ins>Fees</ins>. If you are a User and commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Figure will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Figure for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
        (g) <ins>No Class Actions</ins>. YOU AND FIGURE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Figure agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

10. <strong>Risk Disclosures and Acknowledgement</strong>. Investing, transacting, and engaging in other activities involving digital assets involves risk and may not be suitable for all users.<br/>
By accessing the Service(s), you acknowledge the following risks, which is not intended to be a complete list of all risks related to engaging in digital asset activity:<br/>
Virtual Currency is not legal tender, it is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation Protections;
Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the State, Federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency;
Transactions in Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;
Some Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you or we initiate a transaction;
The value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear;
There is no assurance that a person who accepts a Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future;
The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time;
The nature of Virtual Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack;
The nature of Virtual Currency means that any technological difficulties we experience may prevent the access or use of your Virtual Currency; and
Any bond or trust account maintained by Figure for your benefit may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by you and/or other users.

As stated in Division 8, “the characterization of a person, business, or transaction for purposes of this division does not determine the characterization of the person, business, or transaction for purposes of any other law, regulation, or rule,” including the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and any federal, state or foreign securities laws, rules or regulations. We will execute your instructions with respect to your Digital Assets, subject to these Terms.</li>
<li class="ml-10 pl-2 text-base py-0.5" node="[object Object]"><strong>Control and Customer Instructions</strong>. You control the Digital Assets held in your Digital Asset Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, protocol requirements, time to conduct blockchain operations to fulfill your request and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your supported Digital Assets by sending an instruction through the Services to transfer the applicable supported Digital Asset from your Digital Asset Wallet to a different blockchain address. The private keys, which are used to process transactions for the Digital Assets, will be split across MPC Nodes on a decentralized network.</li>
<li class="ml-10 pl-2 text-base py-0.5" node="[object Object]"><strong>Omnibus Accounts</strong>.

</ol>
<p class="font-medium tracking-wide py-4"><strong>Termination</strong>. By using the Services, you agree that with or without notice or cause Figure Markets may terminate these Terms at any time, and such termination will become effective immediately. In addition, if you fail to comply with any provision of the Terms herein, including, without limitation, the Eligibility requirements, then Figure Markets, acting in its sole discretion, may terminate these Terms and your access to and use of the Services unilaterally and without notice. If Figure Markets terminates your access to and use of the Services in this way, you agree that Figure Markets will not be liable to you or any other party as a consequence of termination or suspension of the Services, and will not be responsible for any consequential claims raised by you or any third parties relating to such termination, as described further herein.
<strong>Survival</strong>. The following provisions will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms for any reason: Sections 4 (Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability), 6.b (Survival), 6.c (Notices), 6.d (Governing Law) and 6.e (Disputes).
<strong>Notices</strong>. From time to time Figure Markets may send notices to you directly, such as via email, web platform, mobile platform, phone, mail or other means. By agreeing to these Terms, you accept constructive or actual notice of notices provided from time to time by Figure Markets.
<strong>Governing Law</strong>. You acknowledge that these Terms will be governed by and/or interpreted under the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.
<strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>
<strong>THESE TERMS INCLUDE A PRE-DISPUTE ARBITRATION CLAUSE. BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS, YOU AGREE AS FOLLOWS</strong>: You and Figure Markets are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.
You and Figure Markets will not commence against the other party a class action, class arbitration or representative action or proceeding.
Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party&#x27;s ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.
The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel in a timely manner prior to the first scheduled hearing date.
The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this agreement.
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms or your use of the Content or Services shall be settled by arbitration in San Francisco, California, in accordance with American Arbitration Association rules and procedures.
Your agreement to the Terms constitutes a waiver of the right to seek a judicial forum unless such a waiver would be void under federal law or the law of the state of California. If you are a resident or national of a country other than the United States, you waive your right to file an action against Figure Markets in any foreign venue.
<strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision of these Terms is later ruled and/or deemed unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms, and the remainder of these Terms will remain fully valid and enforceable despite the severed provision(s).</p></div></div></div></section><!--astro:end--></astro-island>  </main> <astro-island uid="1F95iv" prefix="r2" component-url="/_astro/footer.DPvd1LtP.js" component-export="Footer" renderer-url="/_astro/client.Jg9vGPDa.js" props="{&quot;footerData&quot;:[0,{&quot;footerContent&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;address&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy;2024 Figure Markets&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;650 California, Suite 2700&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;San Francisco CA 94108&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;heading&quot;:[0,&quot;Products&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Trade&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;/crypto-exchange/&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Lend/Borrow&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;/borrow/&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Invest&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;/invest/&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;For institutions&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;/institutional/&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;heading&quot;:[0,&quot;Resources&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Disclosures&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;/disclosures/&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Learn&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.figuremarkets.com/c/learn&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Release Notes&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;/releases/release-notes/&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;heading&quot;:[0,&quot;Customer Support&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Equity Solutions Login&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://equity.figure.com/login&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;socialMedia&quot;:[0,{&quot;links&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;icon&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;logo-white.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1711684010-logo-white.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,2453],&quot;width&quot;:[0,2400]}],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://twitter.com/figuremarkets&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;icon&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;li-in-bug-2.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,null],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1711684278-li-in-bug-2.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,540],&quot;width&quot;:[0,635]}],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/figure-markets&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;icon&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;discord.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,&quot;discord&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1723146537-discord.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,469],&quot;width&quot;:[0,619]}],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://discord.gg/figuremarkets&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;icon&quot;:[0,{&quot;filename&quot;:[0,&quot;telegram.png&quot;],&quot;alt&quot;:[0,&quot;telegram&quot;],&quot;url&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1723146471-telegram.png&quot;],&quot;height&quot;:[0,1553],&quot;width&quot;:[0,1874]}],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://t.me/+N4gMKd2dZys3NWJh&quot;]}]]]}]}]]]}],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Default Long&quot;],&quot;disclaimerType&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;font-weight: 400;\&quot;&gt;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks.
