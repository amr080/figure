Figure Technologies, Inc. and JAM FINTOP are also founding members and will facilitate and promote the adoption of USDF. The Consortium looks to significantly grow its membership of FDIC-insured banks through 2022 and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDF is a bank-minted alternative to non-bank-issued stablecoins. USDF will be minted exclusively by U.S. banks and will be redeemable on a 1:1 basis for cash from a Consortium member bank. USDF addresses the consumer protection and regulatory concerns of non-bank issued stablecoins and offers a more secure option for transacting on blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDF operates on the public Provenance Blockchain. The availability of USDF on a public blockchain means that, in addition to peer-to-peer and business-to-business money transfers, banks and their customers will be able to use USDF for a wide range of applications, including capital call financing as well as invoice and supply chain finance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;USDF opens up endless possibilities for the expanding world of DeFi transactions,&#8221; said Figure CEO Mike Cagney. &#8220;The ease and immediacy of using USDF for on-chain transactions was demonstrated this fall when NYCB minted USDF used to settle securities trades executed on Figure&#8217;s alternative trading systems. We are tremendously excited that NYCB expects to be minting USDF on demand and on a regular basis in the coming weeks.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Consortium was formed to meet the needs of customers demanding more access to blockchain applications for payments and other transactions. &#8220;This will solve a critical need to move funds on blockchain, and it does so in a way that can scale, adheres to regulatory standards, and is acceptable to all users from large institutional investors to retail customers,&#8221; said Andrew Kaplan, NYCB&#8217;s Chief Digital and Banking as a Service Officer. &#8220;As a form of digital currency created and administered by regulated U.S. banks within the USDF Consortium, USDF will enable wide use of an on-chain, real time payments system that satisfies important principles of safety and soundness, compliance with anti-money laundering standards, and financial stability.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The USDF Consortium will allow banks of all sizes, and importantly, community banks, to provide the digital banking solutions that more and more of our clients expect,&#8221; said Valerie Kramer, NBH Bank&#8217;s Chief Digital Officer. &#8220;This aligns with our focus on building out a comprehensive digital financial ecosystem to provide greater access to credit, FDIC-insured depository and treasury management solutions, and integrated financial information, all while lowering transaction costs for small and medium-sized businesses.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our membership in the Consortium will enable us to integrate real-time payments into our operating model, allowing us to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology to streamline multi-party decisioning processes and provide certainty of settlement. We are exploring specific segment-focused use cases that are relevant to our commercial model, including potential applications to commercial lending and loan syndications,&#8221; said Bea Ordonez, Chief Financial Officer of Sterling National Bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The USDF Consortium is doing the foundational work to allow banks to leverage the breakthrough technology of blockchain for responsible innovation and growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Consortium&#8217;s founding bank members and Figure have a representative on the Board of Directors of the Consortium, which will manage the governance, activities, membership, and other aspects of the Consortium.
