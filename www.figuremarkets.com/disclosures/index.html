We may amend or modify the Terms at any time by posting revised terms on the Site or providing a copy to you. Any such revised Terms shall be effective as of the time they are posted but will not apply retroactively.

To access most features of the Service, you must apply for an account (“**Account**”). When applying for your Account on the Service, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your email address, home address, a valid, government-issued photo ID, and other contact information. You agree that: (a) the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times; (b) you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account and for restricting access to it; and (c) you accept responsibility for all activities that occur in your Account or under your access credentials.

Some features of the Service may require that you link to your Account one or more supported blockchain-based digital asset accounts or account storage software applications (each a “**Digital Wallet**”). By linking any Digital Wallet to your Account, you (a) certify that you are the owner of that linked Digital Wallet or that you have appropriate permission or consent from the Digital Wallet owner(s) to link the Digital Wallet; (b) agree that any Digital Wallet information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times; (c) acknowledge that Figure is not responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Digital Wallet or for restricting access to it, and that use of that Digital Wallet is governed by the service and privacy terms of the provider, host, or creator of, or entity that makes available for use to you, that Digital Wallet, if any; and (d) you accept responsibility for all activities that occur in your Account through use of your linked Digital Wallet. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (c) &lt;ins&gt;Consent to Access, Processing and Storage of Your Personal Data&lt;/ins&gt;. During registration for your Account, or for any Additional Service (such as a Figure Wallet (as defined in Appendix B), or at any other time deemed necessary by Figure, you agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification, providing the Service to you, and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crimes and permit us to keep a record of such information. The information we request may include certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification, and information regarding your bank account (such as the name of the bank, the account type, routing number, and account number) and in some cases (where permitted by law), special categories of personal data, such as your biometric information. You consent to us accessing, processing and retaining any personal information you provide to us for the purpose of us providing the Service to you. This consent is not related to, and does not affect, any rights or obligations we or you have in accordance with data protection laws, privacy laws and regulations. You can withdraw your consent at any time by closing your Account. However, we may retain and continue to process your personal information if we reasonably believe it is necessary in order to comply with laws or regulations. In providing us with this or any other information that may be required, you confirm that the information is accurate and authentic. You agree to keep us updated if any of the information you provide changes. You authorize us to make inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries. When we carry out these inquiries, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be disclosed to credit reference and fraud prevention or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our inquiries in full. This is an identity check only and should have no adverse effect on your credit rating. We reserve the right at all times to monitor, review, retain and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, sanctions programs, legal process or governmental request. Further, you authorize your wireless operator to disclose your phone number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, Device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber and Device details, if available, to Figure and Figure Payments and our service providers until these Terms are terminated, solely for identity verification and fraud avoidance. See our Privacy Policy for more information on how we treat your data.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (d) &lt;ins&gt;Payments and Authorization&lt;/ins&gt;. Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are final and non-refundable. You agree to pay any fees that apply to your account. Fees may be deducted or set off from your account balance without prior notice to you. \n\n\nFigure reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service, including any features of the Service or products offered through the Service. Figure will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on our website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Figure may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Figure gives you advance notice of changes before they apply.  Figure will also notify you of the final price of each transaction, inclusive of pricing and fees, when you authorize a transaction and in each receipt we issue to you. Figure, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Figure’s users and merchants. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms. You authorize Figure to charge all sums for any Use of your Account that you confirm through the Service (including through features of the Service, such as QR codes), any orders you make, and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Figure, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your Account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Figure may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase or requested transmission of funds in or out of your Account. Figure may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (e) &lt;ins&gt;Reversals and Cancellations&lt;/ins&gt;.  You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful, if your payment method has insufficient funds, or if you reverse a payment made from funds in your bank account, you authorize Figure, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including your Digital Wallet, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction, which may include additional fees or transaction spreads. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (f) &lt;ins&gt;Third-Party Services and Software&lt;/ins&gt;. Figure may provide tools through the Service that enable you to export information to third-party services, including through features that allow you to link your Account with an account on the third-party service, such as your bank account, or through our implementation of third-party buttons. By using one of these tools, you agree that Figure may transfer that information to the applicable third-party service. Third-party services are not under Figure’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Figure is not responsible for any third-party service’s use of your exported information. The Service may also contain links to third-party websites. Linked websites are not under Figure’s control, and Figure is not responsible for their content. The Service may include or incorporate third-party software components that are generally available free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy, modify, and distribute those components. Although the Service is provided to you subject to these Terms, nothing in these Terms prevents, restricts, or is intended to prevent or restrict you from obtaining those third-party components under the applicable third-party licenses or to limit your use of those third-party components under those third-party licenses.\n2. **Licenses and Ownership**. \n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (a) &lt;ins&gt;Licenses to Service&lt;/ins&gt;. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Figure grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to: (a) install and use one object code copy of any mobile application associated with the Service obtained from a legitimate marketplace (whether installed by you or pre-installed on your mobile device by the device manufacturer) on a mobile device that you own or control (“**Device**”); and (b) access and use the Service, solely for User’s personal, non-commercial use or solely for Company’s internal business purposes, as applicable. Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not: (i) reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or publicly perform the Service; (ii) make modifications to the Service; or (iii) interfere with or circumvent any feature of the Service, including any security or access control mechanism. If you are prohibited under applicable law from using the Service, you may not use it. Except for the limited license granted in these Terms, Figure retains all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Services. The Services constitute Figure’s valuable trade secrets. Accordingly, any unauthorized use or disclosure of information related to the Services would cause Figure irreparable harm. The license granted pursuant to these Terms is not a sale and does not transfer to you title or ownership of the Services or a copy of the Services. ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED UNDER THESE TERMS ARE RESERVED BY FIGURE.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (b) &lt;ins&gt;User Content&lt;/ins&gt;.

Further, you give Figure permission to share your User Content with any third-party with whom you engage or wish to apply to engage, and any service provider that participates in transactions you enter, all as may be further described in the Privacy Policy. By providing User Content, you represent and warrant that: (a) your User Content is true and accurate; (b) your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Figure to violate any law or regulation.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (c) &lt;ins&gt;Retention&lt;/ins&gt;. You acknowledge, consent, and agree that Figure may access, preserve, and disclose content you provide us if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is permitted by our Privacy Policy or reasonably necessary or appropriate for any of the following reasons: (1) to comply with legal process (e.g., a subpoena, court order, or warrant); (2) to enforce these Terms; (3) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (4) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Blend, our agents and affiliates, our users, and the public; or (5) to address your requests.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (d) &lt;ins&gt;Feedback&lt;/ins&gt;. If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the Service or Account (“**Feedback**”), then you grant Figure a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, fully sublicensable, and transferable right to use and incorporate Feedback into any products and services, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise exploit such products and services, and to otherwise use, copy, distribute, and exploit the Feedback without restriction.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (e) &lt;ins&gt;Figure Intellectual Property&lt;/ins&gt;.

YOUR POSSESSION, PERMITTED TRANSFER, AND USE OF ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING YOUR ACCOUNT) IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICE AND YOUR ACCOUNT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, FIGURE AND ALL FIGURE ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING: (I) WARRANTIES OF COMPANY ABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, NON-INTERFERENCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE AND YOUR ACCOUNT; AND (II) WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICE AND YOUR ACCOUNT, AND ANY DATA PROCESSED THROUGH OR USING THE SERVICE IS SECURE, ACCURATE, FREE FROM BUGS, VIRUSES, INTERRUPTION, ERRORS, THEFT OR DESTRUCTION. IF ANY OF THESE EXCLUSIONS DO NOT APPLY TO YOU OR ARE VOID WITH RESPECT TO YOU UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THEN ANY WARRANTY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED IS LIMITED TO THE SHORTER OF: (A) 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FIRST DELIVERY OF THE SERVICE; AND (B) THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.\nNONE OF FIGURE, ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, PROVIDERS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR LICENSORS GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY, TIMELINESS, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, SUITABILITY, AVAILABILITY OR USEFULNESS OF ANY OF THE SERVICES, FOR ANY PURPOSE, AND EACH OF THESE PERSONS DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE SERVICES. NONE OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES AN OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY OR SELL ANY SECURITY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY TRADING STRATEGY. THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE RELIED UPON AS THE BASIS FOR ANY INVESTMENT DECISION. THE SERVICES ARE NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS LEGAL, BUSINESS, OR TAX ADVICE, AND YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN ATTORNEY, BUSINESS ADVISOR, AND/OR TAX ADVISOR IN ORDER TO MAKE AN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION OF THE SUITABILITY AND LEGAL, BUSINESS, AND TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ANY ACTION.

THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THESE TERMS.\n9. **Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate**.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (a) &lt;ins&gt;Generally&lt;/ins&gt;. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Figure in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 9(b) and 9(d), you and Figure agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FIGURE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (b) &lt;ins&gt;Exceptions&lt;/ins&gt;. Despite the provisions of Section 9(a), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (c) &lt;ins&gt;Opt-Out&lt;/ins&gt;. If you are a User and do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 9 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Figure Technologies, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“**Opt-Out Notice**”). Once Figure receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 9 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 10(b). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. Only a User, and in no event a Company, may exercise this opt-out right.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (d) &lt;ins&gt;Arbitrator&lt;/ins&gt;. Any arbitration between you and Figure will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “**AAA Rules**”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org](www.adr.org)  Opens a new window., by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Figure. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (e) &lt;ins&gt;Notice of Arbitration; Process&lt;/ins&gt;. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration is: Figure Technologies, Inc., P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Figure may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Figure must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (f) &lt;ins&gt;Fees&lt;/ins&gt;. If you are a User and commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Figure will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Figure for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (g) &lt;ins&gt;No Class Actions&lt;/ins&gt;. YOU AND FIGURE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Figure agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (h) &lt;ins&gt;Modifications to this Arbitration Provision&lt;/ins&gt;. If Figure makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Figure will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (i) &lt;ins&gt;Enforceability&lt;/ins&gt;. If you are a User and Section 9(g) is found to be unenforceable or if you are a User or Company and the entirety of this Section 9 is found to be unenforceable, or if Figure receives an Opt-Out Notice from you as a User, then the entirety of this Section 9 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 10(b) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.\n10. **Risk Disclosures and Acknowledgement**. Investing, transacting, and engaging in other activities involving digital assets involves risk and may not be suitable for all users.  \nBy accessing the Service(s), you acknowledge the following risks, which is not intended to be a complete list of all risks related to engaging in digital asset activity:  \nVirtual Currency is not legal tender, it is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation Protections;\nLegislative and regulatory changes or actions at the State, Federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency;\nTransactions in Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;\nSome Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you or we initiate a transaction;\nThe value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should the market for that virtual currency disappear;\nThere is no assurance that a person who accepts a Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future;\nThe volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time;\nThe nature of Virtual Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack;\nThe nature of Virtual Currency means that any technological difficulties we experience may prevent the access or use of your Virtual Currency; and\nAny bond or trust account maintained by Figure for your benefit may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by you and/or other users.\n11.  **Miscellaneous**.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (a) &lt;ins&gt;General Terms&lt;/ins&gt;. These Terms, including  any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Figure regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (b) &lt;ins&gt;Governing Law&lt;/ins&gt;. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Figure submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (c) &lt;ins&gt;Notice to California Residents&lt;/ins&gt;. If you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, any questions about pricing, complaints, or inquiries must be sent to Figure Technologies, LLC., Attn: Complaints, P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504. You may also contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.

Please be aware that the Services may permit you to access sensitive and confidential information (“Confidential Information”) regarding Figure and its affiliates and their respective clients or customers (“Disclosing Party”), and such information may be subject to existing confidentiality obligations between you and the Disclosing Party, including, by way of example, a written non-disclosure agreement or employee confidentiality agreement (an “NDA”). Nothing in these Terms provides you a right to disclose, or provide access to, any Confidential Information to any third party in violation of your NDA. The Services and its related information is the confidential information of Figure. You will not disclose any features of, or information pertaining to, the Services to any third party without the prior written approval of Figure, except that you will not be liable for the disclosure of any information which is: (a) in the public domain other than by a breach of these Terms by you; (b) rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; (c) rightfully known to you without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to its receipt from Figure; or (d) generally made available to third parties by Figure without restriction on disclosure. You will immediately notify, and cooperate fully with Figure in the event you discover or suspect any unauthorized use of or access to the Services and/or Confidential Information. \n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (e) &lt;ins&gt;No Support&lt;/ins&gt;. We are under no obligation to provide support for the Service. In instances where we may offer support, the support will be subject to published policies.\n&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (f) &lt;ins&gt;Notice Regarding Apple&lt;/ins&gt;.

Figure makes available to users Digital Wallets that are “self-custody” or unhosted multi-signature (each, a “Figure Wallet”). The Figure Wallet enables users to (i) purchase, store, transfer, and sell digital assets from a blockchain address on the Provenance Blockchain; (ii) link to certain FIgure and third party applications; (iii) obtain additional functionality as Figure may add to the Wallet from time to time; and (iv) view addresses and information that are part of the Provenance Blockchain (collectively the “Wallet Service”).  Figure developed these Wallet specific Terms of Service (these “Wallet Terms”) to describe the terms that govern your use of all versions of the Wallet and the Service.\n\n2. **Digital Wallet Eligibility**. You may use the Wallet Service if you are 18 years or older and are not barred from using the Wallet Service under applicable law.  We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to open a Figure Wallet, suspend or terminate any Figure Wallet, suspend or terminate the sending of digital assets from your Figure Wallet, or suspend or terminate the trading of digital assets in your Figure Wallet. Residents of, or businesses based in, New York, are not eligible or authorized to use a Figure Wallet.\n\n3. **Ownership and Control**. You own and control the digital assets held in your Figure Wallet. As the sole owner of digital assets in your Figure Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such digital assets. You agree that Figure shall have no liability for digital asset fluctuations or loss associated with your use of the Figure Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your digital assets by sending them to a different blockchain address.\n\n4. **Registration and Your Information**. If you want to use the Service, you will have to access your Figure Wallet through electronic private keys (the “Keys”) for your Figure Wallet, or your twenty-four word recovery phrase (“Recovery Phrase”), which is used to access the digital assets associated with your Figure Wallet.  Your Keys and Recovery Phrase will be provided to you after you open the Figure Wallet.\n\nYou are solely responsible for the retention and security of your Figure Wallet credentials.  Anyone that has access to your Recovery Phrase or your Keys can access your Figure Wallet.  You agree that you won’t disclose your Figure Wallet credentials to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Figure Wallet. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Figure Wallet, or are otherwise referable to your FIgure Wallet, whether or not you know about them.  We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your FIgure Wallet, including if you provide inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information, or if you fail to comply with the Figure Wallet registration requirements or these Terms.\n\nIF YOU LOSE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE OR YOUR KEYS, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANY DIGITAL ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR FIGURE WALLET. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FIGURE DOES NOT STORE AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR THE SECURITY OF YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE OR YOUR KEYS.  YOU AGREE TO HOLD FIGURE AND ITS AFFILIATES HARMLESS FOR ANY LOSSES ARISING FROM YOU LOSING YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE OR YOUR KEYS. YOU AGREE THAT FIGURE AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY IF YOU LOSE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE OR YOUR KEYS AND CANNOT ACCESS YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS.\n\n5. **Delegation of Keys**. You may be able to delegate the Keys associated with your Figure Wallet to  a third party through the Service.  If you do so, you will be able to access your Figure Wallet through an access procedure provided by that third party. \n**IF THE THIRD PARTY LOSES, MISUSES, CORRUPTS, DAMAGES, DESTROYS, OR PREVENTS YOU FROM ACCESSING  YOUR KEYS IN ANY OTHER MANNER, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANY DIGITAL ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THE FIGURE WALLET.  YOU AGREE THAT FIGURE DOES NOT STORE AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR THE SECURITY OF ANY KEYS YOU HAVE DELEGATED TO ANY OTHER PARTY.  YOU AGREE TO HOLD FIGURE AND ITS AFFILIATES HARMLESS FOR ANY LOSSES ARISING FROM A THIRD PARTY LOSING, MISUSING, CORRUPTING, DAMAGING, DESTROYING, OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ACCESSING YOUR KEYS IN ANY OTHER MANNER.  YOU AGREE THAT FIGURE AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY IF A THIRD PARTY LOSES, MISUSES, CORRUPTS, DAMAGES DESTROYS, OR PREVENTS YOU FROM ACCESSING YOUR KEYS IN ANY OTHER MANNER AND YOU CANNOT ACCESS YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS**.\n6. **Acknowledgement of Risk**. As with any asset, the value of digital assets can increase or decrease and there can be a substantial risk that you lose money buying, selling, holding, or investing in digital assets.

As part of the Services, we will allow qualifying users to transfer supported and accepted Digital Assets to an account for holding Digital Assets (a “Digital Asset Wallet”) that is connected to the Services. Your Digital Asset Wallet allows you to store, track, transfer and manage your balances of Digital Assets. The private keys, which are used to process transactions, are split using multiparty computation technology and distributed across multiple nodes on a decentralized network (“MPC Nodes”), requiring adherence to a policy that requires multi-party acknowledgment to assemble the full key necessary to complete all transactions.\n6. **Supported Digital Assets**. Your Digital Asset Wallet is intended solely for proper use of Digital Assets that are supported by the Services. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Digital Asset Wallet to store, send, request or receive any assets other than supported Digital Assets. We assume no responsibility in connection with any attempt to use your Digital Asset Wallet with Digital Assets that we do not support or Digital Assets that we do support on an unsupported blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that Figure Markets is not liable for any unsupported Digital Asset that is sent to a wallet associated with your account. You acknowledge and agree that Figure Markets is not liable for a Digital Asset that is sent to a wallet associated with your account via an unsupported network or blockchain.  \nWe may in our sole discretion terminate support for any particular Digital Asset. If you do not sell or send such Digital Asset off platform before we terminate support for such Digital Asset, then we may, in our discretion, remove such Digital Asset from your Digital Asset Wallet and credit your account with the equivalent market value of a supported Digital Asset or other asset minus transaction costs.\n7. **Fungibility of Certain Digital Assets**.  You agree that all forms of the same Digital Asset that may be held and made available across multiple blockchain protocols may be treated as fungible and the equivalent of each other, without regard to: (a) whether any form of such Digital Asset is wrapped; or (b) the blockchain protocol on which any form of such Digital Asset is stored.\n8. **Operation of Digital Asset Protocols**. We do not own or control the underlying software protocols that govern the operation of Digital Assets. Generally, the underlying protocols are open source, and anyone can use, copy, modify and distribute them. We assume no responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and do not guarantee the functionality or security of network operations. In particular, the underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (including “forks”). Any such operating changes may materially affect the availability, value, functionality and/or the name of the Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet or other wallet. We do not control the timing and features of these operating changes. It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes and you must carefully consider publicly available information and information that may be provided by us in determining whether to continue to use a Figure Markets account for the affected Digital Asset. In the event of any such operational change, we reserve the right to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the security and safety of assets maintained via the Services, including without limitation, temporarily suspending operations for the involved Digital Asset(s); we will endeavor to provide you notice of our response to any material operating change, however, such changes are outside of our control and may occur without notice to us. Our response to any operating change is subject to our sole discretion and may include deciding not to support any new Digital Asset, fork or other actions. You acknowledge and accept the risks of operating changes to Digital Asset protocols and agree that we are not responsible for such operating changes and not liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result of such changes in operating rules. You acknowledge and accept that we have sole discretion to determine our response to any operating change and that we have no responsibility to assist you with unsupported cryptocurrencies or protocols. You further acknowledge and accept that we have no responsibility to support new Digital Asset forks or operating changes for Digital Assets.\n9. **Digital Asset Ownership**.  All Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet are owned by you, as described in further detail below.\n10. **Ownership and Title**. Title to Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to Figure Markets or to the operators of any MPC Nodes. All interests in Digital Assets held for Digital Asset Wallets are held for customers; they are not the property of Figure Markets or the operators of MPC Nodes, nor are they subject to claims of the creditors thereof. As owner of the Digital Assets credited to your Digital Asset Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. Figure Markets shall have no liability for Digital Asset fluctuations or loss. None of the supported Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, Figure Markets or the operators of any MPC Nodes; neither Figure Markets nor the operators of any MPC Nodes represent or treat assets in your Digital Asset Wallet as belonging to Figure Markets or the operators of any MPC Nodes. Neither Figure Markets nor the operators of any MPC Nodes may grant a security interest in the supported Digital Assets held in your Digital Asset Wallet. Except as required by law, or as provided herein, neither Figure Markets nor the operators of any MPC Nodes will sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate or otherwise alienate supported Digital Assets in your Digital Asset Wallet unless instructed by you.\n11. **Application of the Uniform Commercial Code**. All Digital Assets credited to the Digital Asset Wallet will be treated as “financial assets” under Division 8 of the California Uniform Commercial Code (“Division 8”). Figure Markets is a “securities intermediary” as used in Division 8 with respect to Digital Assets, and your Digital Asset Wallet is a “securities account” as used in Division 8. As stated in Division 8, “the characterization of a person, business, or transaction for purposes of this division does not determine the characterization of the person, business, or transaction for purposes of any other law, regulation, or rule,” including the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and any federal, state or foreign securities laws, rules or regulations. We will execute your instructions with respect to your Digital Assets, subject to these Terms. \n12. **Control and Customer Instructions**. You control the Digital Assets held in your Digital Asset Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, protocol requirements, time to conduct blockchain operations to fulfill your request and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your supported Digital Assets by sending an instruction through the Services to transfer the applicable supported Digital Asset from your Digital Asset Wallet to a different blockchain address. The private keys, which are used to process transactions for the Digital Assets, will be split across MPC Nodes on a decentralized network.\n13. **Omnibus Accounts**. In order to more securely and effectively operate the Services, shared blockchain addresses, controlled by the operators of MPC Nodes, may be used to transfer supported Digital Assets. Nevertheless, Figure Markets will maintain ledgers for each user’s account.  \n14. **Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability**.

This Disclosure should be read in conjunction with Figure Markets’ [Privacy Policy](/disclosures/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Service](/disclosures/terms-of-service), which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n### What Personal Information is Covered by the CCPA?\n\nUnder the CCPA, “personal information” is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California resident or household.

Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.\n\n## Contacting Us\n\nIf after a significant business disruption, you cannot contact us as you usually do at &lt;a href=\&quot;mailto:support@figuresecurities.com\&quot;&gt;{&#39;support@figuresecurities.com&#39;}&lt;/a&gt;, you should call us at &lt;a href=\&quot;tel:888-851-4883\&quot;&gt;(888) 851-4883&lt;/a&gt;. If you cannot access us through any of those means, you can visit our website at www.figuresecurities.com and send us your account queries, instructions and requests through online contact links.\n\n## Our Business Continuity Plan\n\nWe plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm&#39;s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.\n\nOur business continuity plan addresses: data backup and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business.\n\n## Varying Disruptions\n\nSignificant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within two (2) hours.\n\nIn a disruption affecting our business district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area and recover and resume business within 1 business day. If the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will assure our customer&#39;s prompt access to their funds and securities.\n\n## For More Information\n\nShould you have any questions concerning our business continuity plan, you may submit a writen request for additional information to our Customer Service Department located at 650 California Street, Suite 2700, San Francisco, CA 94108 or contact us by phone at &lt;a href=\&quot;tel:888-851-4883\&quot;&gt;(888) 851-4883&lt;/a&gt;.\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,null],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Securities Investor Protection Corporation Brochure&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.sipc.org/media/brochures/HowSIPCProtectsYou-English-Web.pdf&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,null],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Website&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.finra.org/&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,null],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Securities and Exchange Commission Website&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.sec.gov/&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;blockchain&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Blockchain Disclosure&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;Investments in and/or the use of blockchain networks, digital asset securities, and private placements have unique risks. Please consider these risks as you evaluate the use of a blockchain technology solution for your individual needs.\n\nBlockchain networks may be required to use a significant amount of time or energy to validate blockchain transactions during periods of heavy volume. As such, settlement times may vary and may not be immediate. Additionally, your transaction may be delayed through no fault of your own, which may cause you to pay a higher price for a digital asset or sell for a lower price due to these processing delays, which could result in significant losses.\n\nA unique private key may be required to access, use, or transfer a digital security on a blockchain or distributed ledger. The loss, theft, or destruction of a private key may result in the irreversible loss of your investment and insurance may be inadequate to cover the loss incurred if your digital wallet is affected.\n\nDue to its nature, blockchain transaction data is equally owned at each place where it&#39;s distributed, and transaction records stored on the chain are permanent.

In some cases, you may have to accept a lower price than you paid for the amount of your digital asset security in order to redeem your investment.\n\nAlternative investments should only be part of your overall investment portfolio.

Additionally, investors may receive illiquid and/or restricted securities that may be subject to holding period requirements and/or liquidity concerns. Investments in private placements are highly illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 5-7 years) should not invest.\n\nInvesting in private placements requires long-term commitments, the ability to afford to lose the entire investment, and low liquidity needs.

Both Figure Asset Management LLC and Figure Investment Advisors LLC are owned by Figure Markets Holdings, Inc. \n\nFigure Investment Advisors LLC, is registered with the [Securities and Exchange Commision (“SEC”)](https://www.sec.gov/) as an investment adviser, and provides advisory services for only the funds.  Figure Investment Advisors provides Investment advisory services to the Funds.  These advisory services do not purport to meet the objectives or needs of specific individuals or accounts, only to the investment objective of the Funds it manages.

Nothing on this webpage is intended as an offer to extend credit, an offer to purchase or sell securities or a solicitation of any securities transaction.\n\n\n## General Risks To All Funds\n\nThe Funds are also considered digital asset securities and have certain risks.  These risks may be found here on the [Figure Markets Digital Asset Securities Disclosure](/disclosures/digital-asset/).\n\nThe Funds also feature many different risks, including: \n\nMARKET RISK: Investments are subject to market pricing and liquidity. Fluctuations in value may occur depending on general market conditions, sector specific changes or collateral considerations. Valuations may be impacted by factors unrelated to the value or condition of its issuer or collateral. Changes in valuations occurring at the time of investment may impact the performance. Analysis of investment pricing history or timing is not guaranteed to be accurate and could result in variance to valuations depending on timing.\n\nSECTOR RISK: Sector concentrations and capital exposure to given sectors will be determined by a client’s board approved Investment Policy or by board designee or overall investment objectives and any specific asset allocation identified by a sophisticated investor. \n\nCREDIT RISK: If debt obligations held in a portfolio are downgraded by ratings agencies, default, or another action reduces the issuers’ ability to pay principal and interest when due, the investment value may decline and a client’s value may be adversely affected.\n\nDERIVATIVES RISK: Investments in derivatives involve risks associated with the underlying asset. Additionally, the risks associated with the derivative may be different or greater than the risks affecting the underlying assets.\n\nINTEREST RATE RISK: Investment value can be influenced by changes in interest rates. Longer duration investments will likely see greater volatility in value with more significant rate movement.\n\nPREPAYMENT/REINVESTMENT RISK: Changes in interest rate risk can either increase or decrease the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows. \n\nOPERATIONAL RISK: The Funds have no employees and are dependent on Figure Investment Advisors to conduct its operations. Figure Investment Advisors will face conflicts of interest as a result of, among other things, the allocation of investment opportunities within the funds, the allocation of time of its investment professionals and the substantial fees that Figure REIT will pay to the Figure Investment Advisors.\n\n\n## Additional Risks Specific To The Figure Markets REIT II\n\nFigure REIT invests in residential mortgage loans, including fixed-rate, simple interest revolving home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and other real estate-related assets\nFigure REIT has held its current investments for a period of time. Also, Figure REIT seeks to opportunistically acquire quality mortgages and other assets that will provide prospective purchasers of the Shares with (i) the preservation and return of their capital contributions, (ii) stable cash flow (including monthly distributions), and (iii) potential liquidity through a possible future listing of the Figure REIT’s common stock on a national stock exchange or through the further development of the Provenance network.  However, you will not have the opportunity to evaluate Figure REIT’s future investments before it makes them and there can be no assurance that any of the investment objectives will be achieved, which makes your investment more speculative. This investment is not suitable for all investors. \n\nDeclines in the value of real estate, economic conditions, property taxes, tax laws and interest rates all present potential risks to real estate investments and may affect the investment yields represented.  Investing in commercial real estate assets involves certain risks, including but not limited to: tenants&#39; inability to pay rent; increases in interest rates and lack of availability of financing; tenant turnover and vacancies; and changes in supply of or demand for similar property types in a given market.\n\nCurrently, there is no public trading market for shares of Figure REIT’s common stock, repurchase of shares by Figure REIT will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares. \n\nFigure REIT’s share repurchase plan will provide stockholders with the opportunity to request that Figure REIT repurchases only after the stockholder has held the shares for a minimum of one year.  Repurchases may only occur if the REIT wishes to repurchase shares of any investor. Keep in mind, Figure REIT is not obligated to repurchase any shares and may choose to repurchase only some, or even none, of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased by any investor. In addition, repurchases will be subject to available liquidity and other significant restrictions. Further, Figure REIT’s board of directors may make exceptions to, modify or suspend its share repurchase plan. As a result, Figure REIT’s shares should be considered as having only limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid. Your ability to have your shares repurchased through Figure REIT’s share repurchase plan is limited, and if you do sell your shares to Figure REIT, you may receive less than the price you paid.\n\nThere is no assurance Figure REIT will pay distributions in any particular amount, if at all. Distributions may be modified and are at the discretion of the board of directors. Distributions are not indicative of profitability, have been in excess of net income and may be funded from sources other than cash flow from operations, including without limitation, the sale of assets, borrowings, return of capital or offering proceeds. There are no limits on the amounts that may be paid from such sources.\n\nThe purchase price and repurchase price for shares of Figure REIT’s common stock will generally be based on the prior month’s NAV and will not be based on any public trading market. While there will be independent valuations of Figure REIT’s properties quarterly, the valuation of properties is inherently subjective, and Figure REIT’s NAV may not accurately reflect the actual price at which its properties could be liquidated on any given day.\n\nPrincipal and interest payments on any borrowings will reduce the amount of funds available for distribution or investment in additional real estate assets.\n\nThe REIT operates on an exemption from registration from the Investment Company Act of 1940 and qualifies as a REIT by meeting a number of organizational and operational requirements. If Figure REIT fails to qualify as a REIT and no relief provisions apply, its NAV and cash available for distribution to its stockholders could materially decrease.\n\nAccurate valuations are more difficult to obtain in times of low transaction volumes due to fewer market transactions that can be considered in the context of the appraisal. There will be no retroactive adjustment in the valuation of assets, Figure REIT’s offering price of its common stock shares, the price Figure REIT paid to repurchase its common stock or NAV-based fees Figure REIT paid to the Figure Investment Advisors to the extent valuations prove to not accurately reflect the realizable value of Figure REIT’s assets. The price you will pay for shares of Figure REIT’s common stock and the price at which shares may be repurchased will generally be based on the prior month’s NAV per share. As a result, you may pay more than realizable value or receive less than realizable value for your investment.\n\n\n## Risks Specific To The Figure Markets Digital Asset Opportunity Fund\n\nInvestors in the Digital Asset Opportunity Fund may not hold the right to enforce terms of loan agreements.  Additionally, access to loan collateral may be limited in the event of default or bankruptcy. \n\nThe Digital Asset Opportunity Fund is not a fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), and is not subject to regulation under the 1940 Act, unlike most private funds. Digital Asset Opportunity Funds are subject to significant risk. An investor may lose all their money. Digital Asset Opportunity Fund is subject to heightened volatility. Digital Asset Opportunity Fund is not suitable for all investors. An investment in Digital Asset Opportunity Funds is not an investment in Solana, Bitcoin, Etherium or any other cryptocurrency or native token.\n\nYou will have no right to participate in the management of Digital Asset Opportunity Fund or in the conduct of its business. As such, you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the Digital Asset Opportunity Fund’s future investments before it makes them and there can be no assurance that any of the investment objectives will be achieved, which makes your investment more speculative.\n\nCryptocurrency trading is generally considered speculative because of the significant potential for investment loss. Among the factors that could affect the value of Digital Asset Opportunity Fund’s investments in cryptocurrencies are cyclical economic conditions, sudden political events, changes affecting a particular blockchain or network, cybersecurity and technological risks including delays in trading, lack of transparency for asset verification, and adverse international monetary and regulatory policies. Markets for cryptocurrencies are likely to be volatile and there may be sharp price fluctuations even during periods when prices overall are rising. \n\nMany digital asset securities are illiquid. This illiquidity may cause extreme price volatility, including the possibility of rapid and substantial price movements, which could result in significant losses. Additionally, as with all private placements, liquidity may pose challenges for market participants trying to exit a position, particularly during periods of volatility. In some cases, you may have to accept a lower price than you paid for the amount of your digital asset security in order to redeem your investment.As such, In some cases, you may have to accept a lower price than you paid for the amount of your digital asset security in order to redeem your investment.\n\n## Risks Specific To The SOL Opportunity Fund\n\nThe SOL Opportunity Fund is not a fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), and is not subject to regulation under the 1940 Act, unlike most private funds. SOL Opportunity Funds are subject to significant risk. An investor may lose all their money. SOL Opportunity Fund is subject to heightened volatility. \n\nLimited Partners will have no right to participate in the management of SOL Opportunity Fund or in the conduct of its business. As such, you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the SOL Opportunity Fund’s future investments before it makes them and there can be no assurance that any of the investment objectives will be achieved, which makes your investment more speculative.\n\nSOL Opportunity Fund has no operating history upon which prospective investors may evaluate its performance. SOL Opportunity Fund’s investment program should be evaluated on the basis that there can be no assurance that the General Partner’s assessment of the prospects of investments will prove accurate or that SOL Opportunity Fund will achieve its investment objective. Past performance of the Principals and the General Partner is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\nAn investment in SOL Opportunity Fund involves substantial restrictions on liquidity. Limited Partners may not liquidate their investment prior to the termination of SOL Opportunity Fund. Although Limited Partners may attempt to increase their liquidity by borrowing from a bank or other institution, Interests may not be readily accepted as collateral for a loan. In addition, transfer of an Interest as collateral or otherwise to achieve liquidity may result in adverse tax consequences to the transferor, and any such transfer is subject to the approval of the General Partner.\n\nSome Digital Assets held by SOL Opportunity Fund may be created, issued, or transmitted using experimental cryptography which could have underlying flaws. Advancements in quantum computing could break the cryptographic rules of protocols which support the assets held by SOL Opportunity Fund. SOL Opportunity Fund makes no guarantees about the reliability of the cryptography used to create, issue, or transmit assets held by SOL Opportunity Fund.\n\nFigure Investment Advisors may require your complete or partial withdrawal of your investment in the SOL Opportunity Fund if it is determined that your continued participation might otherwise subject the SOL Opportunity Fund, or Figure Investment Advisors to material onerous legal, tax or other regulatory requirements that cannot reasonably be avoided without material adverse consequences to any other investor or the SOL Opportunity Fund itself.\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,null],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Form ADV&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://files.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/content/viewform/adv/sections/iapd_AdvIdentifyingInfoSection.aspx?ORG_PK=158307&amp;FLNG_PK=02B8DD4E000801D50383A88104BF9931056C8CC0&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,null],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Disclosure Brochure&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://files.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/Common/crd_iapd_Brochure.aspx?BRCHR_VRSN_ID=865331&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,null],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure REIT Form 8937&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/119559/1736540888-form-8937-fillable-form.pdf&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Payments Corporation Disclosures&quot;],&quot;disclosures&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;money-transmission-disclosures&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Money Transmission Disclosures&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;## Important Disclosures Regarding Money Transmissions\n\n**Alabama**: To file a complaint, contact:\n\nAlabama Securities Commission Attn: Enforcement Division\nPO Box 304700\nMontgomery, AL 36130\n\nTel: 1-800-222-1253\nEmail: asc@asc.alabama.gov\n\nOr submit a complaint online, [here](https://asc.alabama.gov/for-industry/enforcement/complaint-procedure/complaint-form/).\n\n**Alaska**: For Alaska Residents Only:\n\nIf your issue is unresolved by Figure Pay (800-260-1795), please submit formal complaints with the State of Alaska, Division of Banking &amp; Securities.\n\nPlease download the form here:\nhttps://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/3/pub/DBSGeneralComplaintFormupdated.pdf\n\nSubmit formal complaint form with supporting documents:\n\nDivision of Banking &amp; Securities\nPO Box 110807, Juneau, AK 99811-0807\n\nIf you are an Alaska resident with questions regarding formal complaints, please email us at dbs.licensing@alaska.gov or call (907) 465-2521.\n\n**Arizona**: To file a complaint, contact:\n\nArizona Department of Financial Institutions\n100 N 15th Ave., Suite 261, Phoenix, AZ 85007 Tel: 602-771-2800\n\nOr submit a complaint online, [here](https://difi.az.gov/complaint).\n\n**Arkansas**: To file a complaint, contact:\n\nArkansas Securities Department\n#1 Commerce Way, Suite 402, Little Rock, AR 72202\n\nTel: 501-324-9260\nEmail: ASDInfo@arkansas.gov\n\nOr submit a complaint online, [here](https://securities.arkansas.gov/file-a-complaint-2/).\n\n**California**: If you have complaints with respect to any aspect of the money transmission activities conducted at this location, you may contact the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation:\n\nDepartment of Financial Protection and Innovation Consumer Services\n1515 K Street, Suite 200, Sacramento, CA 95814\n\nTel: 1-866-275-2677\nEmail: consumer.services@dbo.ca.gov\n\n**Colorado**:\n\nCUSTOMER NOTICE\n\nEntities other than FDIC insured financial institutions that conduct money transmission activities in Colorado, including the sale of money orders, transfer of funds, and other instruments for the payment of money or credit, are required to be licensed by the Colorado Division of Banking pursuant to the Money Transmitters Act, Title 11, Article 110, Colorado Revised Statutes.\n\nIf you have a Question about or Problem with YOUR TRANSACTION – THE MONEY YOU SENT:\n\n- You must contact the Money Transmitter who processed your transaction for assistance.

Transactions and related services that involve USD are provided through Figure Payments Corporation, Inc. (“**Figure Pay**”). Figure Markets may also use one or more third-party payment processors to process any US dollar (USD) transactions between you and Figure Markets.\n\nThe terms “**Customer**,” “**Account Owner**,” “**Owner**,” “**you**” or “**your**” refer to the owner of the Account (i.e., the person or entity who owns the funds deposited into account, which must match the legal name that the account was opened under and the name that is titled on any linked external third-party bank accounts). These terms apply to any authorized user by the Account Owner that has been established and approved upon account opening.\n\n1. **General Terms.**\n\n**Figure Payments Corporation (“Figure Pay” **or “**Figure**”**)** **provides certain USD services to eligible users. Figure Pay is not a bank**, nor are any of its affiliates. Figure Pay is a licensed money transmitter that provides USD-related services in connection with your account pursuant to applicable [state-issued money transmitter licenses](https://www.figuremarkets.com/disclosures/money-transmission-disclosures/). Your Account is a stored value account provided in connection with your use of Figure Markets’s services. Figure Pay holds your USD Account funds as your agent, on the Owner’s behalf, and the Owner is the ultimate beneficial owner of the funds in your account. Figure deposits customer fiat into one or more FDIC-insured omnibus accounts held for the benefit of our customers at state or federally chartered banks, including Lead Bank, a state-chartered bank with its main office located in Missouri (“**Lead Bank**” or “**Bank**”) and a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“**FDIC**”).\n\nUSD balances of Account Owners are held at an FDIC-insured bank and Owners are eligible for FDIC “pass-through” coverage up to the applicable FDIC limits in place.\n\nUnless explicitly provided otherwise, you will not receive any interest or other return on funds held in these custodial accounts and you agree that any interest or other return earned on funds in any omnibus custodial account, and Figure Pay may be compensated for placing your funds in a custodial account with the Bank. If at any time you become a resident of a restricted jurisdiction, Figure may, in its sole discretion, suspend or close your Account.\n\n**Your use of USD-related services in your account is governed by this agreement and all applicable user agreements.**\n\n(a) Eligibility: Use of USD in Connection with Figure Markets Services is available to U.S. Users only and only users residing in eligible states. For residents of New York and international users**: **we are working hard on offering our fiat services to all users regardless of location, but at this time we do not provide such services to international users and users residing in New York. If at any time you become a resident of a state other than those mentioned above, then the provisions of this Agreement for residents of those states will apply to you.\n\n(b) Consent to the Terms of this Agreement. By accessing the Services, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You further agree to pay any fees or balances due associated with the Account, including giving us the right to collect such fees directly from the balance of the Account. You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information supplied to us in connection with the Account or other services provided by us, and must update that information promptly if it changes.\n\n(c) Modifications. We may amend or change the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time by providing notice to you or posting the amended documents (including this Agreement) on our website. We will provide reasonable notice, when practicable, in writing or by any method permitted by law of an adverse change to this Agreement. When we change this Agreement, the updated version of this Agreement supersedes all prior versions and governs the Account. Your continued access, maintenance, or use of the Account after any change, will be deemed acceptance of any change and you will be bound by it. If you do not agree with changes to the Agreement, you must discontinue using our services, and you may close the Account pursuant to the below procedures.\n\n(d) Closing the Account. To close the Account, you may email us at support@figuremarkets.com or call us at 888-851-4883. Your termination of this Agreement will not affect any of our rights or your obligations arising under this Agreement prior to termination. If your Account is closed, terminated or canceled for any reason, we may return any remaining balance to you by, at our option: (1) mailing a physical check via first-class mail to the mailing address for you in our records, (2) via the automated clearing house (ACH) to the bank account last linked to your Account, or (3) any other reasonable method. For security purposes, you may be required to supply identification and address verification documentation prior to the issuance of a refund check or payment of a refund by other methods. We reserve the right to refuse to process any transaction(s) that we believe may violate the terms of this Agreement, any other applicable user agreement, or applicable law. We may automatically close your Account if the account balance is zero or lower. We may terminate your relationship with us at any time, with or without cause, with or without prior notice. If your Account is closed or terminated for any reason by us, you may not be able to open another Account.\n\n(e) Business Days. Our business days are Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays and days that banking institutions in your state of residence are authorized or required by law or other government action to be closed. Any references to “days&#39;&#39; found in this Agreement are calendar days unless indicated otherwise.\n\n2. **Account Basics.**\n\n(a) Account Eligibility. To open and maintain an Account, you must consent to electronic communications and agree to receive any communications from us (including communications that we may be legally required to provide) in electronic form, rather than paper statements. Accordingly, (i) you must keep us up-to-date with your valid email address and phone number; and (ii) you must agree to accept electronic delivery of all account communications (which can include periodic electronic statements as well as year-end tax forms).\n\nBy using the services provided by us described herein, you represent and warrant to us that: (i) you are at least 18 years of age (or older if you reside in a state where the majority age is older); (ii) you have provided us with a verifiable street address (not a P.O. Box) where you reside; (iv) the personal information that you provide to us in connection with the Account is true, correct and complete; and (v) you received a copy of this Agreement and agree to be bound by and to comply with its terms.\n\n(b) Opening an Account. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an Account. When you apply for an Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, social security number, phone number and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.\n\nIf we are not able to validate the identity or authenticity of the Account Owner, the Account may not be opened. We reserve the right to refuse to open an Account, for any reason, at our sole discretion. We may also limit the number of Accounts that you have at our sole discretion.\n\nWe may use information from, and share information with, third parties to help us determine if we should open an Account.\n\n3.  **General Account Information.**\n\nYour Account offers a variety of services related to your use of USD in connection with our services, including onboarding and offboarding from and to your own bank account.\n\n(a) USD Wallet.

To the extent possible, we will provide reasonable notice if your access to a feature changes or will no longer be available to you.\n\n(b) No Cash, Paper Checks, or Foreign Currency. We expressly disclaim any liability for lost or misdirected items (including cash, paper checks, and foreign currency) that you mail to us or that we attempt to return to you. We are not liable for any funds, including cash or paper checks that may become lost in the mail, lost in transit, not received by us, or not received by you.\n\n(i) Cash – We do not accept account funding using cash.

Detailed information regarding preauthorized transfers is available in Section E, “Electronic Fund Transfer Act Disclosures.”\n\nThe recipient’s name on any direct deposit(s) received must match the name of the Account Owner. Any direct deposits received in a name other than the name registered to the Account will be returned to the originator.\n\n(d) Issues That Could Occur With Adding Funds. If funds are added or transferred into your Account in error, by mistake or otherwise, you consent to us acting to correct the situation by deducting the amount of the added funds from your Account without prior notice to you. If you withdraw such funds prior to our action, and there are not enough funds in your Account at that time, your Account could become overdrawn in violation of our terms of service.\n\n(e) No Overdrafts. You are not permitted to overdraw your Account. If the available balance in your Account ever becomes insufficient to cover any payment or withdrawal you have authorized, we may refuse to process any subsequent transactions you initiate on your Account. If your Account balance becomes negative for any reason, you agree to immediately add funds to cover the negative balance. If your Account has a negative balance for five (5) calendar days or more, we reserve the right to use any funds or digital assets held or deposited to your Account, to set off any amount that you owe us.\n\n5.  **Legal Processes Affecting Accounts.**\n\nIn the event we are served with a garnishment, levy or similar legal process issued by a court or governmental agency, we may be required to place a hold on funds in your Account or to pay funds in your Account to a person or party as instructed by a sufficiently complete legal request. In any such event, we will have no liability if we fail to provide you with notice of such legal process or its requirements. Your Account may be debited for a service fee in connection with our handling of the legal process.\n\nWe also may be required by a court or governmental agency to provide information about the account(s) you maintain with us or about your relationship with us, which may also cause you to incur a service fee, if legally authorized.\n\n(a) Account Holds, Suspensions, and Closures. Without limiting any other right or remedy that we may have under this Agreement or otherwise, we may suspend or close your Account for any reason with or without notice if we, at any time, believe a user is using the Account for fraudulent or illegal purposes, is violating any of our applicable terms of service, or such user otherwise presents an undue risk to us as determined in our sole discretion. Under no circumstances, are we required to provide you with the basis of our decision. Such reasons include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Your use of the Account conflicts with any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, including federal foreign asset control and sanction rules and anti-money-laundering rules, or with our terms and policies governing our services.\n2.

We believe that your use of the service could expose us to increased risk.\n\nIf our monitoring of the Account detects any such activity, the Account funds may be subject to a hold pending review of the activity by us. We may require you and other parties to produce documents and/or other materials to remove any hold and restore services to you. Funds in any Account are subject to hold at our discretion for any legal reason, including until the source of such funds and/or the activity is properly verified. You understand and agree that such action is reasonable for us to take in order to comply with our legal obligations and to prevent us from incurring loss. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to grant or deny reinstatement of your use of the Account, with or without restrictions.\n\n6.  **Limits on Your Account and Obtaining Information.**\n\n(a) Balance Limits.

Although we may use any means to execute your instructions, we normally use the automated clearing house (ACH) to transfer funds. You can transfer money from a bank account at a U.S. financial institution to your Account or transfer money from your Account to a bank account at a U.S. financial institution that is linked to your Account and has been authenticated by you and verified by us.\n\n(b) Account Verification. We may verify your ownership of accounts at a U.S. financial institution from time to time by (a) accessing your account information at the other institution and/or (b) asking you to provide proof of ownership.\n\nIf you have not previously signed up to conduct money transfers, we may verify your ownership of an account through a third party platform. You agree that you are providing that information to us and to the vendor directly so that they and we can access information about your other account online. The vendor’s use of your information is subject to their privacy policy. You represent to us that: (a) the financial institutions you designate have expressly agreed to (or do not prohibit) those actions by us; (b) you have the authority to grant us the right to conduct those activities; (c) you are authorized to conduct transfers to and from the accounts you designate for the transfer; (d) the information you provide to us regarding your accounts at other institutions is accurate and complete; (e) you are an owner or authorized signatory on such accounts, and the account is titled in the same name as your Figure Pay account; and (f) no other person’s authorization is required for us to process your requested transfers.\n\nOther institutions that you choose to transfer money to or from may contact us to verify information about an account or transaction. You agree that we may provide any information needed to verify your instructions or otherwise process a transfer.\n\nNot all types of accounts are eligible for the transfers. You may confirm any restrictions with your financial institution (_e_._g_., 401k, IRA, savings and money market accounts). We are not responsible for any costs, including fees, or losses incurred from fund transfers that are not permitted under such restrictions by the provider of your account or those imposed by applicable law.\n\n(c) External Transfers from your Account. You may transfer funds from your Account to a bank account that you maintain with a U.S. financial institution that is linked to your Account and that we have approved. We will only process transfers to your linked bank account if there are enough funds in your account and such funds are not subject to any hold or other restriction.\n\nAlthough we may use any means to execute your instructions, we normally use the automated clearing house (ACH) to transfer funds. We will remove the funds from your Account when you complete a transfer request through our platform . It may take up to five (5) business days before the funds are credited to your other designated account.\n\nThe cutoff time for submitting transfer instructions is 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). Instructions received after the cutoff hour or on a non-business day may be processed by us on the next business day. Transactions scheduled to be processed on a weekend or bank holiday will be processed on the next business day.\n\n(d) External Transfers to your Account. You may transfer funds from an approved linked bank account that you maintain with a U.S. financial institution to your Account (if your bank permits these kinds of transfers). When you initiate a transfer from your bank, you authorize us to withdraw the funds from your other account. You agree that you will have sufficient funds in your other designated account to cover all transfers to your Account that you set up.\n\nAs with transfers to external accounts linked to your Account, you acknowledge that there will be a delay between the time you are notified of a pending transfer and the date funds are credited to your Account. Although we may use any means to execute your instructions, we normally use the automated clearing house (ACH) to transfer funds. Funds transferred to your Account using the automated clearing house (ACH) will be available to you no later than five (5) business days after you make the transfer.\n\nThe cutoff time for submitting transfer instructions is 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). Instructions received after the cutoff hour or on a non-business day may be processed by us on the next business day. Transactions scheduled to be processed on a weekend or bank holiday will be processed on the next business day.\n\n(e) Declined and Reversed Transactions. We may decline to complete any funds transfer for any legal reason including if: (a) we believe the transaction may involve or result in a violation of law, any liability or a risk of loss; (b) we are unable to authenticate either your Account or your linked bank account; (c) there are insufficient available funds for the transfer; (d) your transfer instruction is unclear, ambiguous, or incomplete; (e) we identify a security risk involving the transaction; (f) we have reason to believe there has been or may be an unauthorized use of your Account; (g) we are unable to verify your identity or authority to use our funds transfer services to our satisfaction; (h) your Account is not in good standing; or (i) we believe in our sole discretion that your use of our funds transfer services could expose us to increased risk; or (j) as otherwise stated in these terms. If we have begun a transfer, and it is rejected for any reason, we will notify you and attempt to return the funds to the other designated account.\n\nIn addition to the limits disclosed above, transfers may be reviewed for fraud and security reasons. You agree that we will not be responsible for any losses or damages that may result from our delay or cancellation of a transfer, or for any failure to notify you of such delay or cancellation.\n\nYou authorize us to return funds to the other bank account if we are advised by the financial institution or the company processing the transfer that the transfer was not authorized by you, was made to your Account in error, or that there were insufficient available funds in the other account for the transaction.\n\n(f) Indemnification/Limited Liability. Unless prohibited by law, you will reimburse us (including our affiliates) and/or our agents for any losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ reasonable fees) that we may incur in connection with your Account, except to the extent that our gross negligence or misconduct caused the losses. We are not liable for special, indirect, or consequential damages, even if previously advised of the possibility of such damages. We cannot guarantee the timely delivery or return of funds as a result of a failure of a financial institution to act in a timely manner.\n\n(g) Suspension and Reinstatement of Funds Transfer Services. In the event that we at any time incur a problem with your use of our money transfer services, including without limitation:\n\n1. we believe it may involve or result in a violation of law or expose us to liability or risk of loss\n2. the inability to debit any of your account(s) or to collect with respect to any of your bank transfers as described above,\n3. if you breach this or any other agreement with us,\n4. we have reason to believe there has been or may be an unauthorized use of your Account,\n5. we are unable to verify your identity or authority to use the service to our satisfaction,\n6. your Account is not in good standing,\n7. we believe that your use of the service could expose us to increased risk, or\n8. for any other reason in our sole discretion.\n\nWithout limiting any other right or remedy that we may have under this Agreement or otherwise, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your right to use the service, immediately and without prior notice to you. You understand and agree that such action is reasonable for us to take in order to protect us from loss. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to grant or deny reinstatement of your use of any of our funds transfer services.\n\n(h) In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Transactions. Telephone us at 888-851-4883, send us an email at support@figuremarkets.com, or write to us at Figure Pay Customer Service, PO Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504 as soon as you can, if you think an error has occurred in your Account. You may request a written history of your transactions at any time by calling or writing us at the number or address above. You will need to tell us:\n\n1. Your name and Account number.\n2. Why you believe there is an error, and the dollar amount involved.\n3. Approximately when the error took place.\n\nIf you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.\n\nWe will determine whether an error occurred within a reasonable amount of business days after we hear from you and we will resolve any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we will notify you. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your Account.\n\nWe will tell you the results within a reasonable number of business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.\n\nIf you need more information about our error-resolution procedures, call us at the telephone number shown above or send us an email at the email address shown above.\n\n8.  **Fees.** You agree to pay any fees that apply to your Account. Fees may be deducted or set off from your Account balance without prior notice to you.\n\n9.  **General Funds Availability.**\n\n(a) Initial Funding. You may initially fund your account by transferring funds from a third-party bank account that you maintain with a U.S. financial institution to your Account (if your other financial institution permits these kinds of transfers).\n\n(b) Subsequent Funding. You may subsequently add funds to your Account by transferring funds from a bank account that you maintain with a U.S. financial institution (if your other financial institution permits these kinds of transfers). We may offer you additional ways to add money to your Account from time to time, and any applicable fees or limits will be disclosed to you at the time they are offered to you.\n\n(c) Limits. We may refuse to accept funds or a transfer to an account, limit its size, or return all or part of it to you or the sender. We reserve the right to limit the amount of funds that may be maintained in your Account. You will not be able to add money to your Account if the added funds will cause you to exceed the maximum allowed account balance, if any.\n\n10. **Additional Terms and Conditions.**\n\n(a) Adjustments. We may make adjustments to your Account whenever a correction or change is required. Adjustments might occur, for example, if transfers are recorded or keyed in the wrong amount or items you submit to be added to your Account are returned unpaid.\n\n(b) Account Contact Information Changes. You agree to notify us immediately in writing of any change in your name, address, email address or other contact information associated with your Account. By updating such information on the App, you satisfy these notification obligations. We may rely on our account records to determine the ownership of your Account.\n\n(c) Compliance. You agree not to violate the laws of the U.S., including without limitation, the economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. You may not use your Account or any Account-related service to process Internet gambling transactions or conduct any activity that would violate applicable law. If we are uncertain regarding the legality of any transaction, we may refuse the transaction or freeze the amount in question while we investigate the matter.\n\n(d) Conflicting Demands/Disputes. If there is any uncertainty regarding the ownership of an Account or its funds, there are conflicting demands over its ownership or control, we are unable to determine any person’s authority to give us instructions, we are requested or directed by any state or local agency to freeze the account or reject a transaction or we believe a transaction may be fraudulent or may violate any law, we may, at our sole discretion: (1) freeze the account and refuse transactions until we receive written proof (in form and substance satisfactory to us) of each person’s right and authority over the Account and its funds; (2) refuse transactions; (3) require the signatures of all authorized signers for the withdrawal of funds, the closing of an Account, or any change in the Account regardless of the number of authorized signers on the Account; (4) request instructions from a court of competent jurisdiction at your expense regarding the Account or transaction; and/or (5) continue to honor transactions and other instructions given to us by persons who appear as authorized signers according to our records. The existence of the rights set forth above shall not impose an obligation on us to assert such rights or to deny a transaction.\n\n(e) Cutoff Hours. Instructions received by us on a weekend, holiday or after our cutoff hour on a business day may be treated and acted upon by us as if received on the next business day.\n\n(f) Death or Adjudication of Incompetence. We may disregard any notice of incompetence unless the person in question has been declared incompetent by a court of appropriate jurisdiction and we receive written notice and instructions from the court regarding the Account. We also may freeze, offset, refuse and/or reverse funds or transactions (_e.g_., governmental or retirement benefit payments payable to the deceased) if an Account Owner dies or is adjudicated incompetent. If we have any question as to the ownership of funds or the amount of funds that belong to any person upon the death of an Account Owner, we may freeze all or part of the Account, pending receipt of proof (satisfactory to us) of each person’s right to the funds.\n\n11. **Deposit Insurance**.\n\nUSD funds that you deposit to your Account and hold in your Account are held by us on your behalf at one or more FDIC-insured banks. Neither Figure Pay, nor its affiliates is a bank. While Figure Pay does not provide banking services to you, it holds your USD balances in one or more FDIC-insured banks, including Lead Bank. Deposit insurance is available for funds held in Accounts that are deposited at Lead Bank or another FDIC-insured bank up to the applicable FDIC limits (currently, $250,000 per depositor) on a pass-through basis.\n\nDeposit insurance protects you against the risk that Lead Bank, or another bank in which customer account funds are held, fails or is placed in receivership. If you have multiple accounts with Lead Bank, directly or through other programs, the account balances will be aggregated for purposes of applying the insurance limit. Your total coverage for all accounts with Lead Bank will be the FDIC insurance limit, no matter how many separate accounts you have with the bank. Figure Pay and its affiliates are not insured by the FDIC and FDIC deposit insurance does not protect you against the risk of Figure’s insolvency or failure. **Your digital asset balances are not covered by FDIC insurance.**\n\nFor more specific and detailed information pertaining to your FDIC insurance coverage, you should visit the FDIC web site at www.fdic.gov. This website has many helpful tools including deposit insurance brochures titled “Your Insured Deposits” and “Deposit Insurance at a Glance,” and an online Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator. You may also contact the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by mail at Deposit Insurance Outreach, Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection, 550 17th Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20429, or by telephone at 1-877-ASK-FDIC (1-877-275-3342).\n\n12. **Force Majeure.** We are not responsible for any loss to you caused by an event that is beyond our control including, but not limited to, natural disasters, wars, insurrection, terrorist acts or threats, riots, strikes, computer failure, fire, loss of power, pandemic, communication or transportation facilities, action or inaction of any governmental authority, or for delays or other failures of the U.S. Mail service, Fedwire, or the failure of any other provider of funds transfer or item processing services.\n\n13. **Other Agreements.** You may have another agreement with us which, by its terms, supersedes this Agreement in whole or in part. For example, certain provisions of your other agreements with us (_e_._g_., involving our online services) may supersede some of the terms of this Agreement, to the extent that they are inconsistent.\n\n14. **Powers of Attorney**. We are not required to recognize any power of attorney to act on an Account. We generally require that powers of attorney meet certain requirements under applicable State law before they will be recognized by us, including that the power be of a type that is recognized as “durable.” We may require the attorney-in-fact to present the original power of attorney before he or she may conduct any transaction involving the Account. We may require the attorney-in-fact to sign an affidavit regarding the attorney-in-fact’s right to act under the power. If we accept a power of attorney, we may continue to recognize the authority of the attorney-in-fact until we receive written notice of revocation or termination of the power of attorney and have had a reasonable time to act upon the notice. We reserve the right to restrict the types or amounts of transactions we will permit an attorney-in-fact to conduct on a case-by-case basis. A person acting under a power of attorney is not, by virtue of the power, an owner of the Account, and no funds in the account belong to the attorney-in-fact by reason of that capacity. The attorney-in-fact has no right of survivorship in the Account by virtue of that capacity.\n\n15. **Monitoring and Recording Telephone Calls and Consent to Receive Communications.**\n\nSubject to federal and state law, we may monitor or record phone calls for security reasons, to maintain a record and to ensure that you receive courteous and efficient service. You consent in advance to any such recording.\n\nTo provide you with the best possible service in our ongoing business relationship for your Account we may need to contact you about your Account from time to time by telephone, text messaging or email. However, we first obtain your consent to contact you about your account in compliance with applicable consumer protection provisions in the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CAN-SPAM Act and their related federal regulations and orders issued by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n- Your consent is limited to your Account, and as authorized by applicable law and regulations.\n- Your consent is voluntary and not conditioned on the purchase of any product or service from us.\n\nYou authorize us to contact you regarding your Account throughout its existence using any telephone numbers or email addresses that you have previously provided to us by virtue of an existing business relationship or that you may subsequently provide to us. This consent is regardless of whether the number we use to contact you is assigned to a landline, a paging service, a cellular wireless service, a specialized mobile radio service, other radio common carrier service or any other service for which you may be charged for the call. You further authorize us to contact you through the use of voice, voicemail and text messaging, including the use of pre-recorded or artificial voice messages and an automated dialing device.\n\nIf necessary, you may change or remove any of the telephone numbers or email addresses at any time using any reasonable means to notify us.\n\n16. **Transfers/Assignments.** Unless otherwise agreed by us in writing, all Accounts are non-transferable and non-negotiable. You may not grant, transfer or assign any of your rights to your Account(s) without our prior written consent. We are not required to accept or recognize an attempted assignment of your Account or any interest in it, including a notice of security interest.\n\n17. **Waivers.** We may delay enforcing our rights under this Agreement without losing them. Any waiver by us shall not be deemed a waiver of other rights or of the same right at another time. You waive diligence, demand, presentment, protest and notice of every kind, except as set forth in this Agreement.\n\n18. **Termination or Suspension of Service** We may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any or all of our services at any time without cause in our sole discretion. We may immediately suspend your use of our services if you breach this or any other agreement with us or we have reason to believe there has been or may be an unauthorized use of your Account.\n\n19. **Severability**. Unless otherwise stated, if any of the provisions of this Agreement are determined to be void or invalid, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n20. **Dispute Resolution; Agreement to Arbitrate.**\n\nYour Account is being made available by us on the basis of your acceptance of our general Terms and Conditions and is subject to the Arbitration Clause therein, which is also provided here for reference.\n\nBy accessing your Account, you acknowledge that you are giving up the right to litigate Claims if either party elects arbitration of the Claims pursuant to this clause, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, and you hereby knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to trial of all Claims subject to this Agreement. You further acknowledge that you have read this arbitration provision carefully, agree to its terms, and are entering into this Agreement voluntarily and not in reliance on any promises or representations whatsoever except those contained in this Agreement.\n\n(a) Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Figure in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 19(b) and 19(d), you and Figure agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FIGURE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n\n(b) Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 19(a), nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n\n(c) Opt-Out. If you are a User and do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 9 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Figure Technologies, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your Account, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“**Opt-Out Notice**”). Once Figure receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 9 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 10(b). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. Only a User, and in no event a Company, may exercise this opt-out right.\n\n(d) Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Figure will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “**AAA Rules**”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at [www.adr.org  Opens a new window.](https://www.adr.org/), by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Figure. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.\n\n(e) Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice of Arbitration**”). Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration is: Figure Technologies, Inc., P.O. Box 40534, Reno, NV 89504. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Figure may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Figure must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.\n\n(f) Fees. If you are a User and commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Figure will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for US$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Figure for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n\n(g) No Class Actions. YOU AND FIGURE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Figure agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n\n(h) Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Figure makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Figure’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Figure will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.\n\n(i) Enforceability. If you are a User and this section is found to be unenforceable or if you are a User or Company and the entirety of this Section iis found to be unenforceable, or if we receive an Opt-Out Notice from you as a User, then the entirety of this Section will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 10(b) of the General Terms and Conditions will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.\n\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION PROVISION, DO NOT USE THE ACCOUNT OR ANY OF OUR SERVICES. YOU MAY CALL 1-888-851-4883 TO CLOSE THE ACCOUNT AND REQUEST A REFUND, IF APPLICABLE.\n&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets Exchange Disclosures&quot;],&quot;disclosures&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;cryptocurrency&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Cryptocurrency Disclosure&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;Investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks. Please carefully read the following which details risks to you as an investor when investing and trading in cryptocurrencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies and virtual currencies are not legal tender in the United States and many question whether they have intrinsic value. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Before investing, please understand that there is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future.\n\nThe price of a virtual currency is based on the perceived value of the virtual currency and subject to changes in sentiment, which make these products highly volatile. Certain virtual currencies have experienced daily price volatility of more than 20%. Before investing, you should consider all risks associated with purchasing cryptocurrencies, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. If you are not prepared to lose your entire invested principal or deposit, then cryptocurrency trading is therefore not appropriate for you. We do not advise you to fund your investments with any funds which may affect your retirement savings, student loans, mortgages, emergency funds, or any funds set aside for other purposes.\n\nVirtual currencies and related “wallets” or spot exchanges include hacking vulnerabilities and a risk that publicly distributed ledgers may not be immutable. A cybersecurity event could result in a substantial, immediate, and irreversible loss for market participants that trade virtual currencies. Even a minor cybersecurity event in a virtual currency is likely to result in downward price pressure on that product and potentially other virtual currencies. By using our services, you knowingly and voluntarily assume this risk.\n\nSeveral factors may affect the price of virtual currencies, including, but not limited to: supply and demand, investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates or future regulatory measures (if any) that restrict the trading of digital currencies or the use of virtual currencies as a form of payment. There is no assurance that any virtual currency will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future, or that acceptance of virtual currency for payment by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will grow.\n\nPlease understand: THERE IS NO REGULATED CENTRALIZED CLEARING OR SETTLEMENT FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSACTIONS, MARKETS OR EXCHANGES. Virtual currencies can be traded through privately negotiated transactions and through numerous virtual currency exchanges and intermediaries around the world. The lack of a centralized pricing source poses a variety of valuation challenges. In addition, the dispersed liquidity may pose challenges for market participants trying to exit a position, particularly during periods of stress. Additionally, virtual currency balances are generally maintained as an address on the blockchain and are accessed through private keys, which may be held by a market participant or a custodian. Although virtual currency transactions are typically publicly available on a blockchain or distributed ledger, the public address does not identify the controller, owner or holder of the private key. Unlike bank and brokerage accounts, virtual currency exchanges and custodians that hold virtual currencies do not always identify the owner. The opaque underlying or spot market poses asset verification challenges for market participants, regulators and auditors and gives rise to an increased risk of manipulation and fraud, including the potential for Ponzi schemes, bucket shops and pump and dump schemes.\n\nVirtual currency exchanges, as well as other intermediaries, custodians and vendors used to facilitate virtual currency transactions, are relatively new and largely unregulated in both the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Virtual currency exchanges generally purchase virtual currencies for their own account on the public ledger and allocate positions to customers through internal bookkeeping entries while maintaining exclusive control of the private keys. Under this structure, virtual currency exchanges collect large amounts of customer funds for the purpose of buying and holding virtual currencies on behalf of their customers. You should be aware, that the opaque underlying spot market and lack of regulatory oversight creates a risk that a virtual currency exchange may not hold sufficient virtual currencies and funds to satisfy its obligations and that such deficiency may not be easily identified or discovered. In addition, many virtual currency exchanges have experienced significant outages, downtime and transaction processing delays and may have a higher level of operational risk than regulated futures or securities exchanges. Please keep this in mind when investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\&quot;SIPC”). In the event of an exchange becoming financially-troubled, your investment is not protected against the liquidation of an exchange.\n\nVirtual currencies currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, virtual currencies are not subject to federal regulatory oversight but may be regulated by one or more state regulatory bodies. In addition, many virtual currency derivatives are regulated by the CFTC, and the SEC has cautioned that many initial coin offerings are likely to fall within the definition of a security and subject to U.S. securities laws. One or more jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect virtual currency networks and their users. Such laws, regulations or directives may impact the price of virtual currencies and their acceptance by users, merchants and service providers. As new regulations are introduced, clients must be aware that a change in domestic or international laws may materially impact their investment including its taxation or cost.. You may be required to pay taxes on any returns and/or increases in value of your investments so you should seek independent tax advice.\n\nThe relatively new and rapidly evolving technology underlying virtual currencies introduces unique risks. For example, a unique private key is required to access, use or transfer a virtual currency on a blockchain or distributed ledger. The loss, theft or destruction of a private key may result in an irreversible loss. The ability to participate in forks could also have implications for investors. For example, a market participant holding a virtual currency position through a virtual currency exchange may be adversely impacted if the exchange does not allow its customers to participate in a fork that creates a new product. We encourage all investors to review our page titled BLOCKCHAIN DISCLOSURE to ensure your understanding of these risks.\n\nMany virtual currencies allow market participants to offer miners (i.e., parties that process transactions and record them on a blockchain or distributed ledger) a fee. While not mandatory, a fee is generally necessary to ensure that a transaction is promptly recorded on a blockchain or distributed ledger. The amounts of these fees are subject to market forces and it is possible that the fees could increase substantially during a period of stress. In addition, virtual currency exchanges, wallet providers and other custodians may charge high fees relative to custodians in many other financial markets. These added fees could possibly reflect the return on your investment. Investors should always carefully consider these fees, as well as, monitoring your investment at all times.\n\nAdditionally, all investors should review the following regulatory advisories on cryptocurrency trading and investing which provide education on the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading:\n\n- [NFA Investor Advisory - Futures on Virtual Currencies Including Bitcoin](https://www.nfa.futures.org/investors/investor-advisory.html)\n\n- [CFTC Customer Advisory - Understanding the Risks of Virtual Currency Trading](https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/%40customerprotection/documents/file/customeradvisory_urvct121517.pdf)\n\n- [CFTC Customer Advisory - Beware Virtual Currency Pump-and-Dump Schemes](https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/%40customerprotection/documents/file/customeradvisory_pumpdump0218.pdf)\n\n- [FINRA Investor Alert - Bitcoin: More than a Bit Risky](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/bitcoin-basics)\n\n- [SEC Investor Alert - Bitcoin and other Virtual Currency-related Investments](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/investoralertsia_bitcoin)\n\n- [FCA alert - warning on cryptoassets](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/fca-warns-consumers-risks-investments-advertising-high-returns-based-cryptoassets)\n\n- [FCA alert - cryptoasset investment scams](https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart/cryptoasset-investment-scams)&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;margin-disclosures&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Risks Associated With Margin Trading on Figure Markets Exchange&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets Exchange Members (“Member”, “Members”, “they”, “their”, “themselves”) use the trading platform operated by Figure Markets (“Exchange”) at their own risk. There can be no assurance that use of the Exchange will provide a positive return or profit, that significant losses will not be incurred, or that a member’s objectives will be achieved. Note, the Exchange is not providing any leverage to any Member.  Members should only use loan proceeds for commercial purposes.  \n\nLeverage allows trading in certain cryptocurrencies or digital assets with limited margin in relation to the value of the digital assets in your wallet/account. The result of this is that even a slight fluctuation of the price of the leveraged cryptocurrency or digital asset could mean substantial gains on leveraged positions when these fluctuations are in your favor but could also mean sudden loss of the allocated margin, and potentially all of the assets in your account, if the fluctuations are to your detriment.\n\nIf a Member decides to use margin on the Exchange it is important to have sufficient relevant experience when entering into these transactions. Margin trading using cryptocurrencies or digital assets is not suitable for everyone. A Member should only fund their wallet and trade with digital assets that they own and can afford to lose. It is possible that a Member may lose a substantial proportion or all of their capital. As a result, Members should carefully consider whether they can afford to bear the risks of loss involved in using margin. The Exchange’s margin trading is designed so that the maximum risk associated for any Member with respect to a position on the Exchange shall not exceed the total actual amount of digital assets in the Member’s wallet/account (by way of fees, funding, margin and/or premium). Members who owe funds after the assets in their account have been liquidated may be blocked from trading until their debts are repaid.  A Member may have a single net position in any given cryptocurrency or digital asset at any time. If a position is liquidated, then the digital assets allocated to that position as margin will be lost, up to the entire amount of the Member’s Account balance.\n\nUnder certain market conditions, particularly given the high volatility and substantial risk of illiquidity in digital asset markets, a Member may find it difficult or impossible to close a position in the market at a favorable price. For example, if there is insufficient liquidity in the market or technical issues with the trade orders that a Member attempts to place, a Member may not be able to manage the risk on their positions. Placing contingent trade orders, such as “Stop” order types, will not necessarily limit a Member’s losses to the intended amounts, since these order types are not guaranteed and market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. The use of leverage can work against a Member as well as for a Member and can lead to large losses as well as gains. The conduct of all trading in a Member’s wallet/account is at a Member’s own risk and Figure Markets does not take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of a Member’s use of the Exchange or any Member’s failure to understand the risks involved in digital assets markets generally or a Member’s use of the Exchange. Additionally, Figure Markets may not accept any orders at its discretion, if it determines a Member is or may be abusing the use of margin trading in their account or violating another Exchange rule or any applicable user agreement. \n\n\nTrade Orders are not monitored by Figure Markets to ensure a Member’s transaction is appropriate for a Member’s risk. Essentially, members must make their own independent assessment as to what level of risk is appropriate for themselves. Members must be able to manage their overall risk appetite. \n\nMEMBERS OF FIGURE MARKETS EXCHANGE MUST ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO MONITOR THEIR ACCOUNT AT ALL TIMES. FIGURE MARKETS EXCHANGE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY ORDERS OR POSITIONS ON, OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF, A MEMBER’S WALLET/ACCOUNT.\n\nSPECIFIC TO RESIDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES\nMembers must certify as Eligible Contract Participants (“ECP”) to be eligible for margin trading. Members are required to have more than $10 million in assets invested on a discretionary basis. The $10 million in assets do not include a Member’s personal residence or other assets that the Member owns that are not part of a Member’s trading or investment portfolio. If you have any questions about whether you qualify as an ECP, you should consult your legal advisor. Figure Markets ensures that a Member’s self-certification will be subject to review. If in Figure Markets’s due diligence we require more information from a Member to verify their status as an ECP, Figure Markets will email that Member with further questions.\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;democratized-prime-terms&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Democratized Prime Terms and Conditions of Service&quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;Last Updated: October 22, 2024\n\nBy applying for a margin account, or engaging in margin trading, you agree to comply with these terms and any other applicable user agreements and you acknowledge and accept the risks of using these services.\n\n\n**1.

Margin Lending and Leverage.**\n\n(a) **Loan-to-Value (“LTV”) Ratio:** The Exchange offers a maximum LTV of 80%. LTV is calculated as the loan amount, divided by the total value of your account (including any funds or assets loaned or purchased on margin).  \n\n(b) **Initial Margin Requirement:** To open a margin position, users must hold collateral in their account to serve as initial margin that corresponds to an LTV of 80%. For example, if a user wishes to borrow $80, they must provide $20 worth of acceptable collateral.\n\n(c) **Leverage:** Figure Markets Credit Cayman Islands allows users to trade positions larger than their account balance. Users may leverage their positions using the borrowed funds up to the maximum LTV of 80%.\n\n**4. Collateral.**\n\n(a) **Acceptable Collateral:** The Exchange accepts only certain digital assets as margin collateral.  Acceptable collateral includes USDC, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.  The list of assets that are accepted as collateral is available on the Exchange’s website and may be updated from time to time.\n\n(b) **Collateral Valuation:** The value of the collateral is determined by the Exchange based on current market prices as determined by the settlement benchmark. The Exchange reserves the right to adjust the valuation of collateral at any time to reflect market conditions.\n\n(c) **Isolated Collateral:** Currently, users may not isolate the collateral held in their margin account from other assets in their exchange wallet or otherwise held in their accounts.  As such, ALL ASSETS IN YOUR ACCOUNT ARE AT RISK OF LOSS DUE TO LIQUIDATION OR RIGHT TO OFFSET TO SATISFY ANY DEBT YOU MAY OWE TO US.\n\n**5. Settlement and Liquidation.**\n\n(a) **Settlement Period:** A user’s margin account will be settled hourly at the beginning of each hour (“Settlement Period”). During each Settlement Period, the Exchange will assess the value of the user’s positions and collateral.  The Exchange reserves the right to change the settlement time and/or period with advance notice to users.\n\n(b) **Margin Calls:** The Exchange does not issue formal “margin calls.”  However, in its sole discretion, it may notify a user that its position is in danger of being liquidated.  If the value of the user’s collateral exceeds the maximum allowable LTV of 90% at any time the user’s account will go into default. In some instances, we may notify you to deposit additional funds or close positions to restore your account to good standing. To avoid unintended liquidations, you must monitor your account closely and deposit additional collateral or repay borrowed funds as needed to ensure that your LTV does not exceed the maximum allowed threshold.\n\n(c) **Automatic Liquidation:** If the LTV margin exceeds the maximum LTV threshold within the specified settlement period, the Exchange has the right, in its sole discretion, to automatically liquidate some or all of the assets in your account (“Automatic Liquidation”).  Automatic Liquidations may cause you to incur losses greater than the collateral you provided in connection with your loan.\n\n(d) **Liability for Losses:** You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for any losses, realized or unrealized, incurred in connection with your account activities and during or as a result of an Automatic Liquidation.  You agree and understand that under no circumstances is Figure liable for “lost” expectation of profits damages.\n\n**6. Fees and Interest.**\n\n(a) **Fees:** The user agrees to pay all fees and commissions, if applicable, associated with the Services, including but not limited to, trading fees, financing fees, liquidation penalties, origination fees, and withdrawal fees.  The fee schedule is available on the Exchange’s website.  Note, some transactions, including lending and borrowing transactions, may incur a minimum fee equal to $0.0000001 USD (or USD equivalent) per transaction.\n\n(b) **Interest on Borrowed Funds:** Interest accrues on an hourly basis.  Payment for interest incurred is required to be made in-kind, i.e., with the borrowed asset type.  If you do not have sufficient assets to cover your interest payment in your account, you will incur an incremental margin loan equal to the interest owed.  If you do not have sufficient collateral in your account to secure additional financing, some or all of your collateral may be liquidated.\n\n**7. Negative Account Balances.**\n\n(a) **Liability for Negative Balances:**  You acknowledge that trading on margin carries risk of loss in excess of your initial deposit amount and you agree to be liable for any activities that would cause your account balance to become negative.  Specifically, in the event that market movements cause your account to incur a negative balance, you agree to be fully liable for the total deficit.\n\n(b) **Recovery of Negative Balances:** Figure Markets reserves the right to recover negative balances by any legal means, including:\n\n\t(i) Directly debiting funds or digital assets from the applicable account or any associated account;\n\t\n\t(ii) Requesting immediate repayment from you for the full negative balance; and \n\t(iii) Immediately liquidating your open positions, without prior notice, to cover the deficit.\n\t\n(c) **Failure to Repay:**  In the event of your failure to repay, Figure Markets reserves the right to terminate this Agreement, restrict your platform privileges, including permission to continue trading,  charge interest on the amount owed at a rate determined by the prevailing platform lending rate, updated each hour, or otherwise 8% per year, compounded daily, pursue legal action, initiate collection activities to recover outstanding balances, or take any other action, as permitted by law, to protect its interests.\n\n**8.  General Risk Disclosures.**\n\n(a) **Risk Acknowledgement:** You agree and understand that margin trading in digital assets involves significant risk, including the potential loss of all of the assets in your account, and that you may incur financial losses exceeding the value of assets in your accounts as a result of market fluctuations. \n\n(b) **Your Responsibility:** You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for understanding the risks associated with margin trading and trading digital assets and that you should only trade with funds/assets that you can afford to lose.\n\n(c) Figure Markets Credit Cayman Islands is **NOT a member of FINRA or the NFA.  It is not registered with either the SEC or CFTC or any similar regulatory authority in any jurisdiction.**\n\n**9. Lend/Borrow Pool Risks.**\n\n(a) **Defaults and Socialized Losses:**  In the event the assets in a lending pool are insufficient to repay lenders, obligations will be covered by the assets contributed to the  insurance fund(s), which is funded, in part, by liquidation penalties.  In the event the assets of the insurance fund(s) are insufficient to cover losses, losses will be socialized among users.\n\n(b) **Liquidity Risk:** You understand and agree that lending and borrowing digital assets exposes you to liquidity risk, as there is a possibility that assets, including a borrower’s collateral, may not be able to be bought or sold quickly enough to prevent or minimize losses.  In instances of limited liquidity, particularly in times of high volatility, large price movements can occur, which may result in outsized or unanticipated losses as well as an inability to execute trades at favorable prices or at all.  Figure Markets does not guarantee the availability of liquidity for trades and it does not guarantee that positions will not be impacted by slippage.  You are solely responsible for assessing the liquidity of assets you transact with and associated risks, including for losses you may incur.

Such decisions may significantly impact you, particularly in areas such as onboarding, identity verification, fraud detection, and transaction monitoring.\n\n* **Logic:** Automated systems analyze biometric data, such as facial geometry, to match your identity against submitted documents.  \n* **Significance:** This process enhances security during onboarding and mitigates fraud risks.  \n* **Consequences:** Errors or inaccuracies may result in delays, denial of service, or additional verification requirements. You have the right to request human intervention and to challenge such decisions.\n\n**10.2\tHow We Use Automated Decision-Making**\n\nAutomated decision-making enables us to provide efficient, secure, and compliant services. The key processes include:\n\n**10.2.1\tOnboarding**\n\n* **Logic:** Algorithms evaluate personal and biometric data, including facial geometry and ID documentation, to verify identity and determine eligibility for account creation.  \n* **Significance:** This ensures a streamlined onboarding experience while maintaining regulatory compliance.  \n* **Consequences:** If the automated process identifies discrepancies or risks, your account creation may be delayed or declined.\n\n**10.2.2\tIdentity Verification**\n\n* **Logic:** Biometric matching compares facial geometry or video selfies against submitted ID documents to confirm identity.  \n* **Significance:** Reduces the risk of identity theft and ensures compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) obligations.  \n* **Consequences:** If mismatches are detected, further manual review or additional documentation may be required.\n\n**10.2.3\tTransaction Monitoring**\n\n* **Logic:** Algorithms monitor transactional patterns, such as amounts, geographic locations, and frequencies, to identify unusual or potentially fraudulent activities.  \n* **Significance:** Protects against unauthorized transactions and ensures compliance with financial regulations.  \n* **Consequences:** Transactions flagged as high-risk may be temporarily withheld for further investigation or reported to regulators where required.\n\n**10.2.4\tFraud Detection**\n\n* **Logic:** Behavioral analysis and pattern recognition algorithms detect unauthorized access or fraudulent behavior.  \n* **Significance:** Safeguards your account and ensures the integrity of our platform.  \n* **Consequences:** Suspicious patterns may trigger additional verification steps or temporary account suspension.\n\n**10.3\tYour Rights Regarding Automated Decision-Making**\n\nUnder Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the following rights:\n\n10.3.1 **Right to Information**\n\nYou may request an explanation of the logic behind the automated decision-making process, including the significance and potential consequences of the decision.\n\n10.3.2. **Right to Human Intervention**\n\nYou may request that a human reviews any decision that significantly affects you instead of relying solely on automated processing.\n\n10.3.3. **Right to Express Your Opinion**\n\nYou can provide feedback or share concerns about any automated decision.\n\n10.3.4. **Right to Contest Decisions**\n\nYou may challenge decisions made by automated processes and request reconsideration.\n\n**10.4\tHow to Exercise These Rights**\n\nIf you wish to exercise these rights or require further details about automated decision-making, including its logic, significance, or consequences, please contact us at [DPO@xpertdpo.com](mailto:DPO@xpertdpo.com)\n\n**10.5\tSafeguards for Automated Decision-Making**\n\nWe have implemented the following safeguards to ensure compliance with GDPR Article 22 and protect your rights:\n\n* **Regular Algorithm Audits:** We regularly test and review algorithms to ensure accuracy, fairness, and compliance with data protection laws.  \n* **Human Oversight:** Where necessary, human intervention is available to review automated decisions.  \n* **Transparency:** We provide detailed explanations of the logic behind automated decision-making processes upon request.  \n* **Data Minimization:** Only the necessary personal data is used for automated decision-making.  \n* **Secure Processing:** Biometric and other sensitive data used in automated decisions are encrypted, pseudonymized, and retained only as long as necessary.\n\n### **11\\.\tPrivacy when Using Digital Assets and Blockchains**\n\n**11.1\tUse of Blockchain Technology**\n\nSome services provided by Figure Markets Ireland utilize blockchain technology. Blockchains are decentralized, distributed ledgers designed to immutably record transactions across multiple computer systems. While this technology ensures security, transparency, and data integrity, it presents unique challenges regarding personal data protection under applicable laws, including the GDPR.\n\n11.2. **Public Nature and Immutability of Blockchain Data**\n\n11.2.1\t**Transparency of Public Blockchains**\n\n* Transactions recorded on public blockchains are visible to all participants of the network.  \n* Although blockchain data is pseudonymized by design (e.g., represented by alphanumeric addresses), it is often subject to forensic analysis. When combined with external datasets, this analysis can potentially lead to the re-identification of individuals and the exposure of personal data.\n\n11.2.2. **Immutability and Its Implications**\n\n* Blockchain transactions are immutable, meaning data recorded on the blockchain cannot be altered or deleted.  \n* This ensures the security and reliability of the blockchain but also means personal data stored on it cannot be erased, modified, or withdrawn.\n\n**11.3\tImpact on the Right to Erasure (GDPR Article 17\\)**\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants individuals the \&quot;Right to Erasure,\&quot; which allows them to request the deletion of their personal data. Due to the immutable nature of blockchain technology:\n\n11.3.1 **Technical Limitations:**\n\n* Personal data recorded on the blockchain cannot be erased or modified.  \n* This is a fundamental feature of blockchain technology and applies to all participants, including Figure Markets Ireland.\n\n11.3.2 **Mitigation Measures:**\n\nTo address these limitations, we have implemented the following measures:\n\n* **Pseudonymization:** Wherever possible, personal data is pseudonymized before being recorded on the blockchain, reducing the likelihood of re-identification. Pseudonymized data, while not removable, cannot be directly linked back to an individual without additional information.  \n* **Off-Chain Storage:** Whenever feasible, we store personal data off-chain and record only necessary references (e.g., transaction hashes) on the blockchain. This allows off-chain data to be deleted or modified in response to erasure requests.  \n* **Balancing Legal and Technical Realities:** While blockchain technology inherently limits the \&quot;Right to Erasure,\&quot; we work to balance GDPR compliance with blockchain&#39;s technical constraints by minimizing the storage of personal data on-chain and providing users with clear guidance on their rights.\n\n**11.4\tPrivacy Measures for Blockchain Transactions**\n\nWe have adopted the following practices to mitigate privacy risks and to aim to ensure compliance with applicable laws:\n\n11.4.1 **Data Minimization**\n\n   * Only the minimum necessary personal data is recorded on the blockchain.  \n   * Sensitive personal data is processed and stored off-chain whenever possible.\n\n11.4.2\t**Pseudonymization and Anonymization**\n\n* Personal data is pseudonymized before being added to the blockchain to minimize the risk of re-identification.  \n* In certain use cases, data may be anonymized to ensure it no longer qualifies as personal data under the GDPR.\n\n11.4.3\t**Transparency and Informed Consent**\n\n* Users are informed of the immutable nature of blockchain transactions before engaging in blockchain-based activities.  \n* Consent is obtained where necessary, particularly when special category data is involved.\n\n11.4.4 **Off-Chain Processing Solutions**\n\n* We prioritize the use of off-chain storage solutions for personal data, enabling greater flexibility for data modification and deletion.Biometric data processed off-chain will be subject to GDPR rights, including erasure. Data recorded directly on the blockchain cannot be erased due to its immutable nature.  \n* Only references or transactional metadata are stored on the blockchain to ensure compliance with GDPR where possible.\n\n**11.5\tUser Responsibilities**\n\nAs a user of blockchain services, it is important to:\n\n* Understand that data recorded on a blockchain is immutable and cannot be deleted or modified.  \n* Exercise caution when sharing personal data in transactions that will be recorded on the blockchain.  \n* Use pseudonymous accounts or wallets to protect your privacy.\n\n### **12\\.\tOur Products and Services are not available to Children**\n\nOur products and services are designed exclusively for individuals aged 18 and older and are not directed at persons under the age of 18 (herein, “Children” or “Child”).

Blockchain Forks**\n\n* **Hard Forks**: Updates to a Virtual Asset’s software may lead to incompatible versions of the blockchain, creating parallel networks. These forks can decrease demand for certain Virtual Assets, adversely impacting their price.\n\n#### **F. Concentrated Ownership Risks**\n\n* **Volatility from Large Holders**: Certain blockchain addresses hold significant portions of a Virtual Asset’s supply. Sudden liquidation from these holders may trigger market volatility and price declines.\n\n#### **G. 51% Attack Risks**\n\n* **Network Manipulation**: If an entity gains control of over 51% of a blockchain network’s computing power, it could manipulate the network by double-spending or reversing transactions. While this is unlikely for major networks, such attacks would erode trust and reduce asset value.\n\n#### **H. Fraud and Cybersecurity Risks**\n\n* **Hacking and Theft**: Virtual Assets are vulnerable to fraud, hacking, and phishing attempts, potentially leading to loss of funds. Clients should adopt secure practices such as enabling two-factor authentication and using trusted wallets.\n\n#### **I. Lack of Investor Protections**\n\n* **No External Protections**: Virtual Assets purchased through Figure Markets Ireland’s Exchange are not covered by external investor compensation, deposit protection, or insurance schemes.\n\n#### **J. Emerging Risks in Novel Virtual Assets**\n\n* **Speculative Nature**: New Virtual Assets or complex transaction strategies may introduce unforeseen risks. The Virtual Asset market is inherently speculative, marked by significant uncertainty, rapid price swings, and market manipulation.\n\n#### **K. Regulatory and Market Risks**\n\n* **Increased Regulation**: Regulatory changes in jurisdictions where Virtual Assets operate may restrict their use, impacting their demand and value. Clients are advised to monitor relevant legal developments.\n\n#### **L. Environmental and Sustainability Risks**\n\nCertain blockchain technologies and Virtual Assets rely on energy-intensive processes, such as Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms. Key risks include:\n\n* **Energy Consumption**: High energy use associated with PoW protocols may lead to increased costs or reputational risks due to environmental concerns.  \n* **Regulatory Impact**: Governments may impose restrictions or taxes on energy-intensive blockchain activities, potentially affecting the availability or value of certain Virtual Assets.\n\n**Client Responsibility**: Clients should consider the environmental and sustainability implications of their Virtual Asset investments and assess whether these align with their values and risk tolerance.\n\n### **Communication Risks**\n\nWhen communicating with Figure Markets Ireland via electronic means, customers should be aware of the following risks:\n\n* **Transmission Failures**: Emails, chats, or other digital messages may fail to send, be delayed, or not reach the intended recipient due to network or technical issues.  \n* **Security Risks**: Electronic communications are not inherently secure and may be intercepted, altered, or accessed by unauthorized parties.  \n* **Impact on Transactions**: Communication failures may result in incomplete or delayed instructions, affecting transaction integrity.  \n* **Verification Responsibility**: Clients are responsible for verifying that critical communications, including transaction confirmations, have been received and executed as intended.\n\n### **Currency Risks**\n\n* **Currency Exchange Fluctuations**: Virtual Asset transactions involving fiat or other virtual currencies may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, potentially leading to additional losses or gains.  \n* **Cross-Border Transaction Risks**: Differences in currency availability and exchange rates across jurisdictions may delay or affect the outcome of transactions.\n\n### **Fees &amp; Charges**\n\nWhen using Figure Markets Ireland Limited’s (“Figure Markets Ireland”) Services, customers should be aware of the applicable fees and charges, as these will directly affect the returns generated.\n\n1. **Fee Transparency**  \n* All applicable fees and charges are outlined in the \\[Fee Schedule\\](insert link to fee schedule). These include, but are not limited to:  \n  * **Trading Fees**: Charges for executing buy, sell, or exchange orders on the platform.  \n  * **Deposit and Withdrawal Fees**: Costs associated with transferring funds to or from your account, including fiat and Virtual Asset transfers.  \n  * **Inactivity Fees**: If applicable, charges for accounts that remain inactive for a specified period.  \n  * **Other Service Fees**: Fees for ancillary services, such as enhanced reporting or expedited processing, where applicable.  \n2. **Fee Changes**  \n* Figure Markets Ireland reserves the right to update fees and charges at its sole discretion. Any changes to the Fee Schedule will be communicated in advance where required by law. Customers are responsible for reviewing the Fee Schedule regularly to stay informed of applicable charges.  \n3. **Impact on Returns**  \n* Fees and charges will reduce the net returns generated from transactions and investments. Customers should consider all applicable costs when evaluating the profitability of using the Services.  \n4. **Third-Party Fees**  \n* Customers may incur additional fees from third parties, such as payment processors, custodians, or banks, which are not controlled by Figure Markets Ireland. Such fees are the sole responsibility of the customer.  \n5. **Currency Conversion Costs**  \n* If transactions involve currency conversion, customers may incur additional fees or costs related to exchange rate fluctuations. These fees may vary depending on the currencies involved and the service provider used.\n\n### **Legal, Regulatory, And Compliance Risks**\n\nVirtual Assets operate in a dynamic legal and regulatory environment that is subject to significant changes. Customers must carefully consider the following risks, as these factors may materially impact the value, use, and accessibility of Virtual Assets and related services.\n\n### **1\\. Legislative and Regulatory Changes**\n\n* **Evolving Legal Landscape**: Laws and regulations governing Virtual Assets are rapidly evolving. Legislative changes may impact the legality, use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Assets.  \n    \n* **MiCAR (Regulation (EU) 2023/1114)**: The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation introduces comprehensive requirements for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs), such as licensing, operational standards, and reporting obligations. Compliance with MiCAR may require modifications to the services offered by Figure Markets Ireland. Customers will be notified of material changes where required.\n\n\n* **Impact on Services**: Legislative changes can restrict or prohibit the availability of certain Virtual Assets or services, with little or no advance notice.\n\n### **2\\. MiCAR-Specific Compliance Risks**\n\n* **Enhanced CASP Obligations**: Under MiCAR, Figure Markets Ireland must meet strict licensing requirements, implement enhanced customer verification, and ensure operational security.  \n* **Service Adjustments**: Customers may experience temporary restrictions, fee changes, or delays during the transition to MiCAR compliance.  \n* **Cross-Border Risks**: MiCAR harmonizes regulations within the EU but does not eliminate risks for clients in non-EU jurisdictions where local laws may impose additional or conflicting requirements.\n\n### **3\\. Jurisdictional and Property Risks**\n\n* **Jurisdictional Restrictions**: Virtual Asset services may be restricted or unavailable in certain jurisdictions due to local regulations. Customers are responsible for ensuring their use of services complies with the laws of their jurisdiction.  \n* **Property Classification**: In some jurisdictions, Virtual Assets may not be classified as “property.” This can affect legal rights, ownership, and enforceability of interests in these assets. Legislative and regulatory changes may adversely affect or restrict (as applicable) the use, transfer, exchange and value of Virtual Assets, as well as the provision of the Services in certain jurisdictions.  Legislative and regulatory changes may occur quickly and without prior notice\n\n### **4\\. Compliance Obligations**\n\n* **Customer Responsibility**: Customers are solely responsible for understanding and complying with applicable local laws, including tax, reporting, and regulatory requirements.  \n* **Tax Reporting**: Figure Markets Ireland may report customer transactions, transfers, and payments to regulatory authorities when required by law. Customers must meet their tax obligations and seek independent tax advice if necessary.  \n* **Non-Compliance Risks**: Failure to comply with local laws may result in penalties, service restrictions, or additional legal obligations.\n\n### **5\\. Non-Compliance and Penalties**\n\n* Non-compliance with MiCAR or other applicable regulations could lead to:  \n  * Regulatory penalties against Figure Markets Ireland or its customers.  \n  * Temporary suspension or permanent withdrawal of certain services.  \n  * Limitations on access to specific Virtual Assets.\n\n### **6\\. Service Modifications and Notifications**\n\n* **Adjustments to Services**: To align with MiCAR and other applicable laws, Figure Markets Ireland may:  \n  * Modify the availability of certain Virtual Assets or features.  \n  * Update terms, conditions, and fee structures.  \n  * Enhance disclosure requirements or transaction limits.  \n* **Advance Notifications**: Customers will be informed of material changes in advance where legally required.\n\n### **7\\. Cross-Border and Systemic Risks**\n\n* **Harmonization vs. Divergence**: MiCAR seeks to harmonize crypto regulations across the EU, reducing legal uncertainty for EU clients. However, customers in non-EU jurisdictions may face overlapping or conflicting regulations.  \n* **Systemic Risks**: Events such as regulatory crackdowns, bans on Virtual Assets, or failures of key platforms can cause market-wide instability and impact the value of Virtual Assets.\n\n### **8\\. Cross-Border Regulatory Risks**\n\nClients engaging with Figure Markets’ services across multiple jurisdictions may encounter overlapping or conflicting regulatory requirements. Key considerations include:\n\n* **Regulatory Inconsistencies**: Laws governing Virtual Assets may differ between jurisdictions, potentially impacting the legality of certain transactions or services.  \n* **Access Limitations**: Clients may face restrictions or prohibitions on Virtual Asset activities depending on local regulations.  \n* **Reporting Obligations**: Clients may have additional reporting or tax compliance requirements in their jurisdiction that Figure Markets does not oversee or facilitate.\n\n**Client Responsibility:** Clients are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws in all jurisdictions where they operate. Independent legal advice is strongly recommended for navigating cross-border regulatory challenges.\n\n### **MARKET RISKS**\n\nInvesting in Virtual Assets involves significant risks. Customers must carefully consider these risks before engaging in any transaction. The value of Virtual Assets can fluctuate significantly, and customers may lose all or part of their investment. Customers should only invest what they can afford to lose.\n\n### **1\\. Speculative Nature of Virtual Assets**\n\n* Virtual Asset trading is inherently speculative. Prices are highly volatile and can change rapidly without warning, driven by factors such as:  \n  * Regulatory developments.  \n  * General economic trends.  \n  * Technological advancements in the Virtual Asset ecosystem.  \n* Market movements are unpredictable, and supply and demand for Virtual Assets may shift quickly, often with little or no advance notice.\n\n### **2\\. Volatility and Unpredictability**\n\n* The value of Virtual Assets is subject to rapid fluctuations, which may occur at any time, including outside standard business hours.  \n* Virtual Asset markets operate 24/7, meaning significant price changes can happen when customers are not actively monitoring their investments.\n\n### **3\\. Systemic and Systematic Risks**\n\n* **Systemic Risks**: These are industry-wide risks that may arise from the collapse or failure of major companies, exchanges, or service providers within the Virtual Asset ecosystem.  \n* **Systematic Risks**: These are broader market-wide risks that stem from external factors such as economic, sociopolitical, technological, or natural events. Both systemic and systematic risks can adversely impact the value of Virtual Assets.\n\n### **4\\. Past Performance Not Indicative of Future Results**\n\n* Historical performance of Virtual Assets does not guarantee or predict future results. Customers should not rely on past trends as an indicator of future outcomes.  \n* Figure Markets Ireland does not provide any assurance or guarantees about the performance, market price, or returns of Virtual Assets available through its Services.\n\n### **5\\. Impact of Technological Developments**\n\n* Blockchain technology is evolving rapidly, and its future growth or sustainability depends on various factors that are difficult to predict.  \n* Advances in technology may render certain Virtual Assets obsolete, while sustainability challenges (e.g., energy consumption or network congestion) may negatively impact Virtual Asset networks.\n\n### **6\\. Perception and Public Sentiment Risks**\n\n* Negative public perceptions or events involving Virtual Assets may reduce investor confidence, leading to heightened volatility or significant depreciation in value.  \n* Events that trigger negative publicity, such as fraud, regulatory crackdowns, or environmental concerns, can have a cascading impact on the entire Virtual Asset market.\n\n### **7\\. Investment Considerations**\n\n* Customers should:  \n  * Conduct independent research to fully understand the risks of investing in Virtual Assets.  \n  * Consider starting with small investments, particularly if they are new to Virtual Assets.  \n  * Regularly monitor their investments and market conditions.\n\n### **Regulatory Status, Classification, and Compliance Risks**\n\n### **Regulatory Status of Figure Markets Ireland**\n\nFigure Markets Ireland Limited is registered with the **Central Bank of Ireland (CBI)** as a **Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP)** for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) purposes.\n\nAs a VASP, Figure Markets Ireland complies with all applicable regulatory requirements, which include:\n\n1. **AML and CFT Obligations**:  \n   * Conducting thorough customer due diligence, including verifying customer identity and assessing the source of funds.  \n   * Monitoring transactions to detect suspicious activities and reporting them to relevant authorities, such as the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).  \n2. **Regulatory Reporting**:  \n   * Submitting required reports to the CBI in accordance with Irish law.  \n3. **GDPR Compliance**:  \n   * Ensuring secure processing, collection, and storage of customer data, including for AML purposes, under the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.\n\n### **MiCAR Transition and Compliance Dependencies**\n\nFigure Markets Ireland operates in an evolving regulatory environment shaped by **Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCAR)**. The regulation introduces harmonized rules for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) across the EU, applicable from December 2024\\.\n\nAs part of its transition to MiCAR compliance, Figure Markets Ireland:\n\n* **CASP Licensing**:  \n  * Will obtain licensing under MiCAR, which extends beyond current VASP requirements to include stricter operational, reporting, and customer protection standards.  \n* **Service Adjustments**:  \n  * Some products, services, or features may need to be modified or temporarily suspended to align with MiCAR requirements. Customers will be notified in advance of any material changes, as required by law.  \n* **Customer Impact**:  \n  * Enhanced disclosures, stricter verification processes, and possible changes to fees or transaction limits may arise as part of MiCAR compliance.\n\n### **MiFID II Classification and Risks**\n\nUnder the **Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II)**, Figure Markets Ireland classifies clients as **retail clients**, **professional clients**, or **elective professional clients**. This classification determines the level of regulatory protection provided to customers and carries associated risks.\n\n1. **Retail Clients**:  \n   * **Protections**: Retail clients receive the highest level of protection, including suitability assessments, detailed risk disclosures, and additional safeguards.  \n   * **Risks**:  \n     * Restricted access to certain high-risk products or services due to regulatory limitations.  \n     * Over-reliance on protections, potentially leading to an underestimation of financial risks.  \n2. **Professional Clients**:  \n   * **Protections**: Professional clients waive some regulatory protections, such as suitability assessments and detailed risk warnings.  \n   * **Risks**:  \n     * Increased responsibility to independently understand and manage investment risks.  \n     * Reduced access to tailored disclosures or protections.  \n3. **Elective Professional Clients**:  \n   * **Protections**: Retail clients may request reclassification as professional clients if they meet specific criteria (e.g., portfolio size, trading experience).  \n   * **Risks**:  \n     * Misjudgment of eligibility or risks may result in financial losses.  \n     * Clients must acknowledge reduced protections and the waiver of retail client safeguards.\n\n### **Reverse Solicitation**\n\nFigure Markets Ireland may provide services under the principle of **reverse solicitation**, where the client engages with the company on their own initiative.\n\n1. **What is Reverse Solicitation?**  \n   * Reverse solicitation occurs when a client independently contacts Figure Markets Ireland to request services, without any prior solicitation or promotion by the company.  \n2. **Regulatory Implications**:  \n   * Services offered under reverse solicitation may not comply with local regulations in the client’s jurisdiction if initiated without solicitation.  \n3. **Risks**:  \n   * **Client Risks**:  \n     * Limited regulatory protections may apply to services accessed through reverse solicitation.  \n   * **Company Risks**:  \n     * Failure to document client-initiated engagements may result in regulatory scrutiny or penalties.\n\n4. **Documentation**:  \n   * Figure Markets Ireland implements strict documentation protocols to confirm that engagements are unsolicited and client-initiated.\n\n**NOVEMBER 2024**&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;eu-cookie-policy&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Figure Markets Cookie Policy &quot;],&quot;link&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:[0,&quot;**LAST REVISED: November 27, 2024**\n\n### **Figure Markets Cookie Policy** \n### **1\\.
